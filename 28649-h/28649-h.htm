<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXIII</h3>


<p>At the meeting of Parliament, on the 31st of January 1854, the
Ministry were able triumphantly to refute the charge of illegitimate
interference in State affairs which had been made by a section of the
Press against Prince Albert; they were, however, severely attacked
for not acting with greater vigour in Eastern affairs. In February,
the Russian Ambassador left London, the Guards were despatched
to the East, and the Russian Government was peremptorily called
upon by Great Britain and France to evacuate the Principalities.
The Peace Party, Bright, Cobden, and others, were active, but
unheeded; the Society of Friends sending a pacific but futile deputation
to the Czar. In March, the demand for evacuation being
disregarded, war was declared, and a treaty of alliance signed between
England and France; Lord Raglan and Marshal St Arnaud
were appointed to command the respective armies, Vice-Admiral
Sir James Dundas and Sir Charles Napier having command of the
Mediterranean and Baltic Fleets respectively. The attitude of
Austria was ambiguous, and, after England and France were committed
to war, she contracted an offensive and defensive alliance
with Prussia, each country engaging to make limited preparations
for war. At home, with a view to greater efficiency, the duties of
the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, till then united in a
single Secretaryship, were divided, the Duke of Newcastle assuming
the former office, while Sir George Grey became Colonial Secretary;
Lord John Russell also resumed office as President of the Council.
The Russians were unsuccessful in their operations against the Turks,
notably at Silistria and Giurgevo, while, as the summer advanced,
public opinion in support of an invasion of the Crimea rose steadily,
the <i>Times</i> indicated the taking of Sebastopol as indispensable, and
Lord Aberdeen's hand was forced. On the 28th of June, the Cabinet
sanctioned a despatch to Lord Raglan, urging (almost to the point of
directing) an immediate attack upon Sebastopol; the French Emperor
was in favour of the plan, though both Commanders-in-Chief
entertained doubt as to whether it was immediately feasible. On the
7th of September, the allied forces (58,000 strong) sailed from Varna,
a landing being effected a few days later at Old Fort, near Eupatoria;
at about the same time an important interview took place at Boulogne
between Prince Albert and the Emperor Napoleon. The signal
victory at the Alma, on the 20th of September, was followed by the
death of St Arnaud, and the appointment of Canrobert as his successor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.2" id="pageiii.2"></a>[page&nbsp;2]</span>
Decisive successes were next obtained at Balaklava on the
25th of October, and at Inkerman on the 5th of November; but on
the 14th a fierce gale did immense damage to life and property, both
at Balaklava and on the sea. Meanwhile, indignation at home was
aroused by the tidings of the breakdown of the commissariat and
transport departments, and the deplorable state of the hospitals;
Miss Florence Nightingale, who had sailed from England with a
number of nurses, arrived at Scutari early in November, and proceeded
to remedy deficiencies as far as possible; while Lord John
Russell vainly urged on the Premier the substitution of Lord Palmerston
for the Duke of Newcastle as Secretary for War. Sir Charles
Napier, who, previously to his departure with the Baltic Fleet, had
been f&ecirc;ted at the Reform Club, and extravagantly lauded by Cabinet
Ministers, was by the month of October engaged in a recriminatory
correspondence with the First Lord of the Admiralty. At about the
same time the Patriotic Fund was established under the presidency of
Prince Albert.</p>

<p>In Parliament, the last vestige of the old Navigation System,
limiting the coasting trade to British ships, was repealed, and a Bill
also passed for preventing corrupt practices at elections. Owing to
the war, the Reform Bill was withdrawn, Lord John Russell, on
announcing the fact in Parliament, being overcome, and giving way
to tears. In the short session, which took place during the latter
half of December, a Foreign Enlistment Act was passed, providing
for a force of 10,000 foreigners, to be drilled in this country.</p>

<p>The Exhibition Building, which had been constructed in Hyde
Park in 1851, and had been re-erected at Sydenham, was opened with
great ceremony by the Queen, and was henceforth known as the
Crystal Palace.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h5>1854</h5>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>6th January 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Lord Aberdeen</span> presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He cannot wonder at the indignation expressed by your
Majesty at the base and infamous attacks made upon the Prince
during the last two or three weeks in some of the daily papers.<sup>1</sup>
They are chiefly to be found in those papers which represent
ultra-Tory or extreme Radical opinions; but they are not
sanctioned by the most respectable portion of the Press.
Lord Aberdeen has received some information respecting the
origin of these attacks; but it is vague and uncertain. At
all events he believes that your Majesty may safely make yourself
at ease upon the subject, as he is satisfied that these hostile
feelings are shared by few. It is much to be desired that some
notice of the subject may be taken in Parliament, when, by
being treated in a proper manner, it may be effectually stopped.
Lord Aberdeen has spoken to Lord John Russell, who will be
quite prepared to moot it in the House of Commons.</p>

<p class="ind">It cannot be denied that the position of the Prince is somewhat
anomalous, and has not been specially provided for by
the Constitution; but the ties of Nature, and the dictates
of common sense are more powerful than Constitutional
fictions; and Lord Aberdeen can only say that he has always
considered it an inestimable blessing that your Majesty should
possess so able, so zealous, and so disinterested an adviser.
It is true that your Ministers are alone responsible for the
conduct of public affairs, and although there is no man in
England whose opinion Lord Aberdeen would more highly
respect and value, still if he had the misfortune of differing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.4" id="pageiii.4"></a>[page&nbsp;4]</span>
from His Royal Highness, he would not hesitate to act according
to his own convictions, and a sense of what was due to your
Majesty's service.</p>

<p class="ind">The Prince has now been so long before the eyes of the whole
country, his conduct so invariably devoted to the public good,
and his life so perfectly inattackable, that Lord Aberdeen
has not the slightest apprehension of any serious consequences
arising from these contemptible exhibitions of malevolence
and faction.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty will graciously pardon Lord Aberdeen for
writing thus plainly; but there are occasions on which he
almost forgets your Majesty's station, and only remembers
those feelings which are common to all ranks of mankind.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 1: A section of the Press, favourable to Lord Palmerston, had insinuated that his resignation
was due to "an influence behind the throne." Similar attacks were made by
other journals, and not abandoned upon Lord Palmerston's re-admission to the Cabinet:
the most extravagant charges of improper interference in State affairs were made against
the Prince, and it was even rumoured that he had been impeached for high treason and
committed to the Tower! The cartoons in <i>Punch</i> usually present a faithful reflection
of current popular opinion, and in one of them the Prince was depicted as skating, in
defiance of warning, over dangerous ice.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">PERSIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>9th January 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thanks Lord Clarendon for his letter just received
with the enclosures.</p>

<p class="ind">As the proposed answer to the Emperor contains perhaps
necessarily only a repetition of what the Queen wrote in her
former letter,<sup>2</sup> she inclines to the opinion that it will be best
to defer any answer for the present&mdash;the more so, as a moment
might possibly arrive when it would be of advantage to be
able to write and to refer to the Emperor's last letter.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the Persian Expedition<sup>3</sup> the Queen will not
object to it&mdash;as the Cabinet appears to have fully considered
the matter, but she must say that she does not much like it
in a moral point of view. We are just putting the Emperor of
Russia under the ban for trying "to bring the Sultan to his
senses" by the occupation of part of his territory after a
diplomatic rupture, and are now going to do exactly the same
thing to the Shah of Persia!</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 2: See <i>ante</i>, vol. ii, pp.

<p class="note1">Footnote 3: Under the belief that Persia had declared war against Turkey, and that diplomatic
relations between England and Persia were suspended, the Cabinet had agreed upon the
occupation of the Island of Karak by a British force.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>9th January 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I wrote you a most abominable
scrawl on Friday, and think myself justified in boring you
with a few words to-day.</p>

<p class="ind">The plot is thickening in every direction, and we may
expect a great confusion. The dear old Duke used to say
"You cannot have a little war." The great politicians of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.5" id="pageiii.5"></a>[page&nbsp;5]</span>
Press think differently. The Duke told me also once: "At
the place where you are you will always have the power to
force people to go to war." I have used that power to <i>avoid</i>
complications, and I still think, blessed are the peacemakers.</p>

<p class="ind">How the Emperor could get himself and everybody else into
this infernal scrape is quite incomprehensible; the more so as
I remain convinced that he did not aim at conquest. We have
very mild weather, and though you liked the cold, still for
every purpose we must prefer warmth. Many hundred boats
with coal are frozen up, and I am told that near two hundred
ships are wanting to arrive at Antwerp....</p>

<p class="ind">I am much plagued also by little parliamentary nonsense
of our own here, a storm in a bottle; this is the way of human
kind, and in such cases it always pleases me to think that I am
not bound to be always their working slave, and I cast a sly
look at my beautiful villa on the Lake of Como, <i>quite furnished</i>.... My
beloved Victoria. Your devoted Uncle.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE PRESS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>13th January 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Victoria</span>,&mdash;I grieve to see how unjustly you
are plagued, and how wonderfully untrue and passionate are
the attacks of part of the Press. Abuse is somewhat the <i>staff
of life in England</i>, everything, everybody is to be abused; it is
a pity, as nothing more unproductive as this everlasting abuse
can well be imagined. As nothing ever gave the slightest
opening to this abuse, it is to be hoped that it will be soon got
over&mdash;the meeting of Parliament will now do good in this
respect. As far as your few continental relations are concerned,
I don't think they will be able to fix anything upon
your faithful servant. I have done England at all times
good services, in the sense of her best interests. I hold a
position of great geographical importance for England, just
opposite the mouth of the Thames. Successes of vanity I am
never fishing for in England, nor anywhere else. The only
influence I may exercise is to prevent mischief where I can,
which occasionally succeeds; if war can be avoided, and the
same ends obtained, it is natural <i>that</i> <span class="sc">that</span> <i>should be tried
first</i>.
Many English superficial newspaper politicians imagine that
threatening is the thing&mdash;I believe it the worst of all systems.
The Emperor Nicholas and Menschikoff wanted by threatening
the Turks to get certain things, and they have by that means
got a very troublesome and expensive affair on their hands.
I wish England too well to like to see it, but one of these days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.6" id="pageiii.6"></a>[page&nbsp;6]</span>
they will get into some scrape in the same way. The foolish
accusation that we are doing all we can to break up the French
Alliance is certainly the <i>most absurd of all</i>; if anything can be
for our local advantage, it is to see England and France closely
allied, and for a long period&mdash;for ever I should say....</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE FRENCH ALLIANCE</span>
<p class="ind">I have heard, and that from the Prussian Quarter, that
great efforts are making on the part of Russia, to <i>gain over</i>
Louis Napoleon. I understand, however, that though Louis
Napoleon is <i>not</i> anxious for war, that his opinion is favourable
to the continuation of a good understanding with England.
That it should be so is, I must say, highly desirable. The
poor Orleans will be grieved and hurt by all these things. The
death of the child of the poor Queen of Spain will not be a
favourable omen for Spain.<sup>4</sup>...</p>

<p class="ind">With my best love to Albert. Believe me ever, my beloved
Victoria, your truly devoted Uncle,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Leopold R.</span></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 4: A daughter had been born to the Queen of Spain on the 5th of January, and lived
only three days.
</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE ORLEANS FAMILY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>16th January 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sends the answer she has this morning received
from the Duc de Nemours, which she hopes is on the whole
satisfactory as regards the reported visit of the Count de
Chambord.<sup>5</sup> The Duke does not see in so strong a light as <i>we</i>
do, the danger of even the <i>report</i> being believed&mdash;probably
from living so much out of the world as he does. What would
Lord Aberdeen wish her to do farther, and what does he think
can be done in the way of contradiction? The Queen wishes
likewise to have Lord Aberdeen's opinion and advice on the
following subjects. He knows that we have invariably received
the poor Orleans family (in particular our own near relations,
the Nemours) from time to time <i>here</i> and in London, and that
the Queen has <i>always</i> from the first year done this <i>openly</i> but
<i>unostentatiously</i>. It is by <i>no means</i> her intention to change her
conduct in this respect&mdash;but since the great noise caused by
the "fusion" she thought it better <i>not</i> to invite the Nemours
either to Osborne or here, hoping that by <i>this time</i> these tiresome
rumours would have ceased. They have not, however,
and we think that perhaps it would be wiser <i>not</i> to see them
here, <i>at any rate</i> till after the meeting of Parliament, though
it is very painful to the Queen to hurt their feelings by apparent
neglect. Is Lord Aberdeen of this opinion, and does he think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.7" id="pageiii.7"></a>[page&nbsp;7]</span>
that it will <i>not</i> be misconstrued into an <i>admission</i> of having
encouraged <i>intrigues</i> or of <i>submission</i> to the will and pleasure
of Louis Napoleon?</p>

<p class="ind">For the Queen would never submit to such an accusation,
nor would she continue (after the excitement is past) to exclude
these poor exiles from occasional visits&mdash;which have been
paid and received ever since <i>'48</i>, and which would be unworthy
and ungenerous conduct.</p>

<p class="ind">Likewise does Lord Aberdeen think that a morning visit to
the Duchess of Aumale to enquire after her health would be
imprudent?</p>

<p class="ind">It goes much against the Queen's feelings of generosity and
kindness to neglect the poor exiles as she has done this winter,
but the present moment is one of <i>unparalleled</i> excitement and
of great political importance, which requires great prudence and
circumspection. There is an admirable article in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> of to-day, taking quite the <i>right line</i> upon the
infamous and <i>now</i> almost ridiculous attacks on the <i>Queen</i>
and Prince. Has Lord Aberdeen any idea who could have
written it?</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sends a letter she had received from her Uncle,
which may amuse and interest him. To make the statement
of the Queen's intercourse with the Orleans family quite
clear, she should add, that when the family visit the Queen
or she visits them, that it is put into the Court Circular, and
this of course gets copied into country papers and foreign
papers; but after consideration the Queen thought this the
wiser course, for with all the spies who are no doubt about&mdash;if
this were not done, and the Queen's visits and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>
were suppressed and <i>yet</i> found out&mdash;it would give them an air
of <i>mystery</i> which is just what we wish to avoid.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 5: Son of the Duc de Berri, and known formerly as the Duc de Bordeaux. (See <i>ante</i>,
<a href="../../20023/20023-h/20023-h.htm#pagei.495" style="font-weight: normal;">vol. i. p. 495</a>.) The Duc de Nemours denied all knowledge of the rumoured visit, and
thought its importance had been exaggerated.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>17th January 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">... With respect to your Majesty's custom of seeing the
French Royal Family, Lord Aberdeen humbly thinks that
there is no good reason for making any change. It has always
taken place without parade or ostentation; and knowing, as
Lord Aberdeen does, that no political object is in view, he
would feel ashamed to advise your Majesty to do anything
at variance with that sympathy which your Majesty has been
careful to keep within the bounds of prudence and moderation....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen hopes that he may venture to congratulate
your Majesty on the commencement of a change with respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.8" id="pageiii.8"></a>[page&nbsp;8]</span>
to the newspaper attacks upon the Prince. He observed
the article, to which your Majesty refers, in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> of yesterday; and he believes he may certainly say
that it was written by Mr Gladstone, although he would not
wish it to be known. There was also a very sensible letter in
the <i>Standard</i> of last night, signed D. C. L. This is the signature
always assumed by Mr Alexander Hope,<sup>6</sup> in his contributions
to the Press, and Lord Aberdeen does not doubt that it
is written by him. It is only a wonder to find it in such a
quarter; and it shows some disposition on the part of that
scurrilous paper to alter its course. There is perhaps no great
objection to the papers dealing with the subject as they think
proper, before the meeting of Parliament, provided the <i>Times</i>
takes no part at present; for as this paper is supposed to be
influenced by the Government, this belief would injure the
effect of anything that might appear in its columns.<sup>7</sup>...</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 6: Mr. A. J. Hope (afterwards Beresford-Hope), at this time out of Parliament, had
written over the signature "D.C.L." a series of letters to the Press on the Papal claims.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 7: On the re-assembling of Parliament, the charges against the Prince were at once
refuted by the Prime Minister and Lord John Russell; and his right to assist the Queen
completely established by those Ministers, with the concurrence of Lord Derby and Mr
Walpole, on behalf of the Opposition, and Lord Campbell, the Chief Justice of the Queen's
Bench.
</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE REFORM BILL</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>21st January 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of the
19th, and the Bill as now agreed upon by the Cabinet, which
she hopes may meet the wishes of the Country and pass into
law.<sup>8</sup> From what she understands the chief argument used
in opposition to the measure will be, that corruption and bribery
is the evil which the Country really complains of, and not an
unequal distribution of the representation, and that a new
distribution or even extension of the franchise will not touch
the evil, and may be said perhaps in some instances to tend
towards increasing it. The success of the measure will therefore,
she concludes, in some degree depend upon the Bribery
Bills which will accompany it. How far are these advanced?
and what expectation has Lord John Russell of succeeding in
framing such a measure as would remove that ground of
objection to the Reform Bill?</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 8: Notwithstanding the impending war, the Government considered itself bound in
honour to bring in a Reform Bill. Lord Palmerston and his special supporters were
opposed to the project, but the measure was brought forward on the 13th of February.
After a chequered career it was withdrawn. The Bill for the prevention of corrupt
practices at elections was introduced on the 10th of February, and after many vicissitudes
and several Ministerial defeats in the Commons as well as in the Lords, it was, in a modified
form, carried.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>7th February 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must apologise for having kept the enclosed
papers so long, and in now sending them back she does so
without feeling sure in her mind that she could with safety
sanction Mr Gladstone's new and important proposal.<sup>9</sup> The
change it implies will be very great in principle and irretrievable,
and the Queen must say that Lord John Russell's apprehensions
as to the spirit it is likely to engender amongst the future civil
servants of the Crown have excited a similar feeling in her mind.
Where is moreover the application of the principle of public
competition to stop, if once established? and must not those
offices which are to be exempted from it necessarily degrade
the persons appointed to them in public estimation?</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 9: Mr Gladstone had written on the 26th of January on the subject of competitive
examinations for the Civil Service; in reply to the Queen's letter, he referred to the
discontent existing in the Service with the system of appointment by favour, and of
promotion by seniority alone.

<span class="rightnote">THE BALTIC COMMAND</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Admiralty</span>, <i>9th February 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to lay before
your Majesty certain important considerations which were discussed
at the Cabinet yesterday with respect to the selection of
a Commander-in-Chief for the Fleet about to be appointed for
Service in the Baltic.<sup>10</sup>...</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Dundonald<sup>11</sup> is seventy-nine years of age; and though
his energies and faculties are unbroken, and though, with his
accustomed courage, he volunteers for the Service, yet, on the
whole, there is reason to apprehend that he might deeply commit
the Force under his command in some desperate enterprise,
where the chances of success would not countervail the risk of
failure and of the fatal consequences, which might ensue. Age
has not abated the adventurous spirit of this gallant officer,
which no authority could restrain; and being uncontrollable
it might lead to most unfortunate results. The Cabinet, on the

boldness with discretion.<sup>12</sup> He has served in large squadrons,
and he has commanded them. As a Second, he may not have
been submissive; as a Chief, he has been successful in command.
His appointment will give confidence both to officers
and men; and his name is not unknown both to enemies and
allies. If he has the faults of his family, he is not without their
virtues; courage, genius, love of country are not wanting;
and the weighty responsibilities of high command, without
oppressing him, would give steadiness to his demeanour.</p>

<p class="ind">He behaved ill to Lord John Russell and to Sir Francis
Baring; and on shore he has given just cause of complaint;
but at sea and in command he is a different person; and Lord
John Russell in the Cabinet yesterday, regardless of all former
displeasure, pronounced an opinion favourable to the appointment
of Sir Charles Napier. Lord Aberdeen, also, together
with the entire Cabinet, came to the same conclusion; and Sir
James Graham on their behalf, and in concurrence with his own
opinion, ventures to ask the permission of your Majesty to
appoint Sir Charles Napier to this important Naval command.<sup>13</sup></p>

<span class="rightnote">THE BRITISH ARMY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>24th February 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must write to Lord Aberdeen on a subject which
at this moment appears to her of paramount importance&mdash;viz.,
the augmentation of the Army. The ten thousand men by
which it has been ordered to be augmented can hardly be considered
to have brought it up to more than an improved <span class="sc">Peace</span>
<i>establishment</i>, such as we have often had during profound peace
in Europe; but even these ten thousand men are not yet
obtained. We have nearly pledged ourselves to sending twenty-five
thousand men to the East, and this pledge will have to be
redeemed. To keep even such a force up in the field will require
a strong, available reserve at home, of which we shall be quite
denuded. But we are going to make war upon Russia!
encouraging Austria and Prussia to do so likewise, whereby we
assume a moral obligation not to leave them without assistance.
We engage in a War which may assume in its course a totally
different character from that of its beginning. Who can say
it is impossible that our own shores may be threatened by
powers now in alliance with us? We are powerless for offence
or defence without a <i>trained</i> Army; to obtain this will require
considerable time. The Queen must, therefore, urge Lord
Aberdeen to consider with the Cabinet whether it will not be
essential to augment the Army at once, and by at least thirty
thousand men. Considerations of home policy make this also
advisable; the country is eager for War at this moment, and
ready to grant men and money. It will be a great facility
hereafter to have obtained what is most needed at first. If
the force should finally not be wanted, retrenchments may very
easily be made. The Crown should at least have the power of
raising the men without the necessity for further application to
Parliament.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE BRITISH ULTIMATUM</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>26th February 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen, with his humble duty, begs to inform your
Majesty that another Cabinet was held to-day, in order to
consider the draft of a letter which it is proposed that Lord
Clarendon should address to Count Nesselrode, and in which
he should summon the Russian Government to evacuate
the Principalities. The messenger will be directed to wait
six days for an answer, and the British Government will
consider the refusal or the silence of Count Nesselrode as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.13" id="pageiii.13"></a>[page&nbsp;13]</span>
equivalent to a declaration of War, and proceed to act
accordingly.<sup>15</sup></p>

<p class="ind">An assurance has been received, in general terms, of the
intention of Austria to support this demand; and a telegraphic
message has been sent to Vienna with a desire to know whether
the Austrian Government will join in this summons, or in what
manner support will be given.<sup>16</sup> No answer has yet been received,
and Lord Aberdeen would think it right not to make the
summons until Austria has declared her intention; but the
Cabinet appears to desire that the letter should be sent to-morrow
evening.</p>

<p class="ind">The period fixed for the complete evacuation of the Principalities
is the 30th of April.</p>

<p class="ind">As it cannot be supposed that the Emperor of Russia will
listen to such a demand as this, immediate hostilities must be
expected, with all their consequences.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 15: This summons to evacuate the Principalities, and an ultimatum to a similar purport
from Paris, were delivered to the Czar on the 14th of March; on their receipt the Czar
intimated that he did not think it fitting (<i>convenable</i>) that he should make any reply.
His decision was known in London on the 24th.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 16: The attitude of Austria caused great perplexity. Count Orloff had gone to Vienna
to obtain a pledge of neutrality in the event of war, but refused to give the Emperor
Francis Joseph satisfactory assurances as to the Czar's future policy, and, in particular,
as to the evacuation of the Principalities at the close of the war. The Austrian Government
accordingly announced its intention of acting as circumstances might dictate, but
subsequently limited the assistance which it now expressed itself willing to give to England
and France in insisting upon the evacuation, to diplomatic support.

the exact terms of "the general assurance" which Austria has
given with respect to it. The Queen, however, does not doubt
for a moment that the gain of a day or two in making the

summons. The messenger is to wait <i>six</i> days for an answer,
but no longer.</p>

<p class="ind">The last battalion of the Guards (Scots Fusiliers) embarked
to-day. They passed through the courtyard here at seven

Abbey&mdash;and an immense crowd collected to see these
fine men, and cheering them immensely as they with difficulty

<p class="indright">[<i>Undated.</i>]</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen was rather annoyed at the manner in which Lord
Clarendon pressed the Duke of Cambridge's going to the
Tuileries last night.<sup>17</sup> She thought it an immense boon upon
her part to allow the Duke of Cambridge <i>to go to Paris</i>&mdash;and
instead of its being considered as such by Lord Clarendon and
Count Walewski, the Queen was told it would offend the
Emperor if the Duke did not go to the Tuileries also. The
Queen observed that it was unnecessary and unusual for the
Duke, or any Prince almost, to live at the <i>Palace</i> of the Sovereign,
unless he was a very particular friend or near relation.
The Duke of Genoa had refused going there, though he had
received other civilities here; in the same manner <i>no Prince</i>
comes to this <i>Palace</i> unless he is a very <i>near relation</i> or
particular
friend. To this Lord Clarendon replied that it was "because
the <i>Emperor wished</i> it," which rather shocked the Queen,
and she spoke <i>strongly</i> to him upon the subject. The result
was that the Queen said she would speak to the Duke of Cambridge
about it, and see, as the Emperor made <i>so great a point
of it</i>, and Lord Clarendon considered that the <i>Alliance depended
upon it</i>, what he would do....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must and <i>will</i> protest, for she cannot mix up
personal friendship with a political Alliance. The former is
the <i>result</i> of the <i>experience</i> of years of mutual friendship, and
cannot be <i>carried by storm</i>....</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.15" id="pageiii.15"></a>[page&nbsp;15]</span>

<p class="ind">There would be nothing unusual in apartments being offered
to the Duke of Cambridge, and declined by him. This was
done by the King of the Belgians only last summer at Berlin
and Vienna, without anybody's construing it into an affront.
The Queen adds a list of the Royal personages who have been
in England and never resided at the Palace. Lord Aberdeen
may show this letter to Lord Clarendon.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 17: The Duke was going to the Crimea, and it was arranged that he should stop at Paris
on the way.

<span class="rightnote">STABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>1st March 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has to acknowledge Lord John Russell's letter of
this morning. Much as she must regret the postponement of
the second reading of the Reform Bill, she must admit its wisdom
under the present peculiar circumstances;<sup>18</sup> but she doubts the
advantage of naming a precise day after Easter on which it is to
come on. Considering the <i>importance</i> to the country of <i>preserving</i>
the present Government and of not allowing it to be beat
on so vital a question, the opportunity should not be lost of
ascertaining the state of feeling both in the House of Commons
and in the country after the reassembling of Parliament, before
the Government decide on entering upon the struggle which
the carrying through of the measure might entail. It is quite
impossible <i>now</i> to conjecture with certainty what that state of
feeling and the general political circumstances at home and
abroad may be at that time. Possibly the country may be
more eager <i>then for</i> the measure&mdash;or the War may <i>disincline</i>
it <i>altogether</i> towards it.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen seizes this opportunity of expressing her sense of
the <i>imperative importance</i> of the Cabinet being <i>united</i> and of one
mind at this moment, and not to let it <i>appear</i> that there are
differences of opinion within it. The knowledge that there are
such is a cause of <span class="sc">great</span> <i>anxiety</i> to the Queen, at a time when
she is to enter upon a European War, of which nobody can
confidently predict the extent.</p>

not only of <i>paramount importance</i> at the <i>commencement</i> of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.16" id="pageiii.16"></a>[page&nbsp;16]</span>

personal honour or reputation to the well-understood interests
of the Country. Indeed, the Queen cannot conceive the
possibility of their collision, as an exclusive regard for the
well-understood interests of the Country must always redound
to the honour and reputation of a Statesman.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 19: Lord John Russell had announced the decision of the Government to postpone till
the 27th of April the second reading of the Reform Bill, and, in reply to some sarcastic

anything connected with his own personal reputation to the interest of the country. He

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>17th March 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Dear Sir and Brother</span>,&mdash;General Count von der Gr&ouml;ben
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.17" id="pageiii.17"></a>[page&nbsp;17]</span>
has brought me the official letter of your Majesty, as well as
the confidential one,<a id="footnotetagXXIII21" name="footnotetagXXIII21"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIII21"><sup>21</sup></a> and I send your kind messenger back,
with these two answers to you. He will be able to tell you,
orally, what I can express only imperfectly in writing, how
deep my pain is, after our going so far, faithfully, hand in hand,
to see you, at this weighty moment, separating yourself from
us. My pain is still further increased by the fact that I cannot
even conceive the grounds which move your Majesty to take
this step.</p>

<p class="ind">The most recent Russian proposals came as an answer to
the <i>last</i> attempt for an understanding which the Powers
believed could be arrived at honourably, and they have been
rejected by the Vienna Conference, not because they were not
in accordance with the literal wording of the programme, but
because they were contrary to the intention of it. Your
Majesty's Ambassador has taken part in this Conference and
its decision, and when your Majesty now says: "The task
of Diplomacy ceases at the exact point where that of the
Sovereigns emphatically begins"; I am unable to assent to
such a definition. For what my Ambassador does, he does in
my name, and I feel myself not only bound in honour thereby,
but also placed under an obligation to take upon myself the
<i>consequences</i> which the step which he is directed to take may
lead to.</p>

<p class="ind">The dreadful and incalculable consequences of a War weigh
upon my heart not less than on your Majesty's. I also know
that the Emperor of Russia does not wish for it. He, none
the less, demands from the Porte things which all the Powers
of Europe&mdash;among them, yourself&mdash;have solemnly declared
to be incompatible with the independence of the Porte, and
the European balance of power. In view of this declaration
and of the presence of the Russian Army of invasion in the
Principalities, the Powers could not but be ready to confirm
their word by action. If "the Turk" now goes into the
background, and if the approaching War appears to you as a
"War of tendency" this is the case only because the very
motives which may induce the Emperor to insist on his demands&mdash;in
defiance of the opposition of the whole of Europe,
and with the danger of a War that may devastate the
world, do betray a <i>distinct tendency</i>, and because the grave
consequences of the War must appear much more momentous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.18" id="pageiii.18"></a>[page&nbsp;18]</span>
than the original ostensible cause of it, which at first
appeared only as the request for a key to the back door of
a mosque.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty asks me "to examine the question in a spirit
of love for peace, and even now to build a bridge for the
Imperial honour." Ah, my dear Sir and Brother, all the inventive
gifts, all the architecture of diplomacy and of goodwill,
have been uselessly wasted during these last nine months in
this bridge-building! The <i>Projets de Notes, de Conventions, de
Protocoles</i>, etc., etc., have proceeded, by the dozen, from the
Chancelleries of the different Powers, and one might call the
ink wasted on them another Black Sea. But everything has
been shipwrecked against the self-will of your honourable
brother-in-law.</p>
<span class="rightnote">PRUSSIAN NEUTRALITY</span>
<p class="ind">If now your Majesty informs me "<i>that now you mean to persist
in complete neutrality</i>," and if, on this occasion, you refer
us to your Nation, who are said to exclaim with sound common
sense: "Acts of violence have been done by the Turks, the
Turk has good friends in large numbers, and the Emperor has
done us no harm"&mdash;I do not understand you. Certainly I
should understand this language if I heard it from the Kings
of Hanover or of Saxony. But I have, hitherto, looked upon
Prussia as one of the Great Powers which, since the peace of
1815, have been guarantors of treaties, guardians of civilisation,
defenders of the right, the real arbiters of the Nations;
and for my part I have felt the divine responsibility of this
sacred office, without undervaluing at the same time the heavy
obligation, not unconnected with danger, which it imposes on
me. If you, dear Sir and Brother, abdicate these obligations,
you have also abdicated that position for Prussia. And
should such an example find imitators, then the civilisation of
Europe would be delivered up to the play of winds; right will
then no longer find a champion, the oppressed will find no
longer an umpire.</p>

<p class="ind">Let not your Majesty believe that what has been said in this
letter is aimed at persuading you to change your resolves; it
flows from the affectionate heart of a sister, who could not
pardon herself, were she not, at so weighty a moment, to let
you see into her inmost soul. So little is it my intention to
desire to win you over to our view, that nothing has grieved me
more than the suspicion, expressed in your name by General
von der Gr&ouml;ben, that England had desired to seduce you
from your purpose by opening a prospect of advantages to
be gained. The baselessness of such a supposition is evident
from the Treaty itself which had been offered to you, and
whose most important clause consisted in the promise of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.19" id="pageiii.19"></a>[page&nbsp;19]</span>
contracting parties, <i>not to desire in any case to derive from the
War any advantage for themselves</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty could not have given a more powerful proof
of your unselfishness than by the very fact of attaching your
signature to this Treaty.</p>
<span class="rightnote">WAR DECLARED</span>
<p class="ind" style="margin-bottom: -0.5em;">To come to a close. You suppose that War may already
have been declared; you express, however, at the same time,

<p class="ind">The Queen rejoices to see the Debate was favourable in the
House of Lords, and that it was concluded in the House of
Commons.<sup>23</sup></p>

<p class="ind">She is rather startled at seeing Lord Aberdeen's answer to
Lord Roden upon the subject of a day of humiliation, as he has
never mentioned the subject to her, and it is one upon which
she feels strongly. The only thing the Queen ever heard about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.20" id="pageiii.20"></a>[page&nbsp;20]</span>
it was from the Duke of Newcastle, who suggested the <i>possibility</i>
of an <i>appropriate</i> prayer being introduced into the
Liturgy, in which the Queen quite agreed; but he was
strongly against a day of humiliation, in which the Queen also
entirely agreed, as she thinks we have recourse to them far
too often, and they thereby lose their effect. The Queen therefore
hopes that this will be reconsidered carefully, and a <i>prayer</i>
substituted for the <i>day of humiliation</i>. Were the services
selected for these days of a different kind to what they are&mdash;the
Queen would feel less strongly about it; but they always
select chapters from the Old Testament and Psalms which
are so totally inapplicable that it does away with all the effect
it ought to have. Moreover, really to say (as we probably
should) that the <i>great sinfulness of the nation</i> has brought
about this War, when it is the selfishness and ambition of <i>one</i>
man and his servants who have brought this about, while our
conduct has been throughout actuated by unselfishness and
honesty, would be too manifestly repulsive to the feelings
of every one, and would be a mere act of hypocrisy. Let
there be a prayer expressive of our great thankfulness for the
benefits we have enjoyed, and for the immense prosperity of this
country, and entreating God's help and protection in the
coming struggle. In this the Queen would join heart and soul.
If there is to be a day set apart, let it be for prayer in this sense.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 23: On the 27th of March the Queen announced to Parliament that the negotiations with
the Czar had terminated, and that she felt bound "to afford active assistance to her ally,
the Sultan." Next day the Declaration of War was issued, containing a narrative of
the events which finally led to the rupture. The debates on the Address in answer to the
message took place on the 31st of March, Mr Bright, in the Commons, censuring the
declaration, and being replied to by Lord Palmerston. The addresses were presented to
the Queen on the 3rd of April.

<span class="rightnote">THE REFORM QUESTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>9th April 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is anxious to express to Lord John Russell the
extreme satisfaction she experiences at the communication
Lord Aberdeen yesterday evening made her of the settlement
of the Reform Question, viz., of its postponement for the
present Session, with the understanding that it is to be brought
forward again whenever the state of affairs will admit of its
being fairly and calmly considered by Parliament.<sup>24</sup> The
sacrifice of personal feeling which no doubt this may cost Lord
John will, she is certain, be amply compensated by the conviction
that he has done so for the interest and tranquillity
of his Sovereign and Country, to whom a dissolution of the
present Government would have been a source of immense
danger and evil.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 24: From a memorandum, made by Prince Albert, of interviews with Lord Aberdeen,
it appears that before the Cabinet of the 8th of April Lord Palmerston declared that under
neither present nor any future conditions could he vote for the second reading of the
Reform Bill. Lord John thereupon tendered his resignation; this Lord Aberdeen asked
him to suspend until after the meeting of the Cabinet.

<span class="rightnote">DISSENSION IN THE CABINET</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Pembroke Lodge</span>, <i>9th April 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your
Majesty; he cannot think it consistent with fairness to
conceal from your Majesty the deep feelings of mortification
which affect him on reviewing the proceedings of the Cabinet
yesterday.<sup>25</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen was the only person who behaved with due
regard to the honour of the Administration. The rest appeared
ready to sacrifice everything in order to keep the Ministry
together; and Lord John Russell feels bound to warn your
Majesty that, although he was quite willing to waive the consideration
of the Reform Bill for the present Session, he is not
ready to consent that it shall be entirely set aside in order to
keep together a Ministry whose continuance would be dearly
bought at the price of the welfare of the Country, and the
consistency of public men. Lord John Russell must reflect
further on this subject before he comes to a final determination.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL</span>
<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 25: Lord John Russell's actions at this period of his career seem often incomprehensible;
but his private domestic anxieties seem to have weighed him down. Having made the
great sacrifice, for an ex-Premier, of taking office under an old opponent, he was now
engaged in trying to regain the first place for himself. Lord Aberdeen had always contemplated
retiring in his favour, but would not give up the Premiership in the face of the
dangers threatening the country. Moreover, he had believed his continuance in office to
be a guarantee for peace. Lord John Russell, after accepting the Foreign Office, had
then insisted on being a Minister without office; later still, by displacing Mr Strutt and
transferring Lord Granville to the Duchy, he himself became Lord President of the
Council, an office which no commoner had held since the reign of Henry VIII. By such
action, coupled with perpetual threats of resignation, he marred his prospects of succeeding
Lord Aberdeen, and, as will be seen, failed in his attempt to construct an Administration
when the opportunity was offered him.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>10th April 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen received Lord John Russell's letter last night.
She is much grieved that he should be "affected by deep
feelings of mortification on reviewing the proceedings of the
Cabinet." From all the Queen had heard of the views of the
different members of the Cabinet, she believes them to have
been fully convinced that the present moment would be inopportune
to press the Reform Bill, but <i>quite</i> prepared to take it
up again on the first fitting opportunity; she, of course, does
<i>not</i> speak of Lord Palmerston.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen would, no more than Lord John, wish to see
"the Reform Bill set aside in order to keep together a Ministry,"
but does not consider the decision of the Cabinet at
all to imply this, whatever Lord Palmerston's personal wishes
may be, and trusts that the Country will fully understand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.22" id="pageiii.22"></a>[page&nbsp;22]</span>
appreciate the motives which have guided the Government.
Lord Aberdeen and Lord John will always receive every support
from the Queen when they shall think it right to propose
the re-introduction of the measure.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>10th April 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen has just left the Queen, after an interview
which he had had with Sir James Graham and Lord John
Russell at Lord John's request. He reported that at that
interview Lord John renewed his complaint of the Cabinet,
declared that he could not state to the House what was untrue,
and must therefore resign. Lord Aberdeen called this "really
too monstrous" after the pledge given by the Sovereign, himself
as Prime Minister, and the whole Cabinet, with the exception
of one man, and he would repeat his promise that
whenever Lord John said, "The Reform Bill is to come on,"
and Lord Palmerston opposed it, he should go.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John could not be appeased, but spoke with the greatest
bitterness. He had written to Lord Palmerston in the same
sense; and Lord Palmerston's answer arrived during the
interview. It was to the effect that if one of them was to resign,
it was not Lord John, who agreed with the rest of the Cabinet
upon the Bill, but himself, who was the dissentient. Lord
Aberdeen asked Lord John whether Lord Palmerston's resignation
would satisfy him; to which he answered, he believed it
would not mend matters. Lord Aberdeen's opinion, however,
is that it is what Lord John, and still more what Lady John,
wants. He thinks the Country will never understand how the
Government could break up, and that Lord John is cutting
his own throat, and told him so. If Lord John went, he could
not go on with Lord Palmerston as Leader of the House of
Commons, which he called "perfectly ludicrous." Lord
Palmerston would probably insist upon this, however; Lord
Palmerston's retirement would be a great blow to the Government,
as the Country persisted in thinking him the only able
War Minister, and would cry out at "the imbecile old Head
of the Government having it now all his own way." He
thought, should he not be able to go on, new combinations
could be formed, perhaps under the Duke of Newcastle and
Mr Gladstone, as the Country liked younger men. Lord
John must give his answer in the House of Commons to-morrow
at half-past four. Lord Aberdeen would wish to see
the Duke of Newcastle, Sir James Graham, and Mr Gladstone,
as his more particular friends, this evening, to discuss the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.23" id="pageiii.23"></a>[page&nbsp;23]</span>
whole question with them, and would see Lord Palmerston
and Lord John to-morrow, before he could make any report
to the Queen.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty;
he has the honour to acknowledge, with gratitude, your Majesty's
communication of yesterday. Lord John Russell waited to
see Lord Aberdeen before he answered, and having now had a
long conversation with him, Lord John Russell being assured
of your Majesty's support, of Lord Aberdeen's concurrence, and
of the assent of the majority of his colleagues, is willing to

him, and, as he used the word 'suspicion' in reference to his motive, his utterance was
choked, and the sentence he struggled to pronounce was evidently given through tears."

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>11th April 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">We saw Lord Aberdeen at three o'clock to-day, who reported
to the Queen that the change of mind of Lord John had been
the result of an hour and a half's discussion with him this
morning. He must admit, however, that he found Lord John
in a mood willing to let himself be convinced. The Queen's
letter might have contributed to this as well as the entreaties
of the Duke of Bedford and Lord Lansdowne. Lord Aberdeen
could tell Lord John in truth that there was not a shadow of
difference of opinion amongst any of his friends, that he would
lose himself for ever, and meet with universal reprobation, if
he persisted in resigning after every cause for it had been
removed, and he had agreed to the course Lord Palmerston had
insisted upon. Lord Palmerston had written a very clever
letter to Lord John, begging him not to desert the Queen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.24" id="pageiii.24"></a>[page&nbsp;24]</span>
the Country, which, if he read it to the House of Commons,
would floor Lord John completely.</p>

<p class="ind">We asked what had been agreed upon at yesterday evening's
meeting. Lord Aberdeen told us the decision, under the
impression that Lord John would resign, had been for Lord
Aberdeen to call upon Lord Palmerston, and to explain to him
that although he had acted cordially with him as a Colleague
in this Government, yet they had been political antagonists
during their whole lives&mdash;the Government also was still a
Reform Government; from personal, therefore, as well as
public, reasons it was impossible that he should be entrusted
with the lead of the House of Commons, being the only anti-Reformer.
And it was hoped that he would have no difficulty
in letting Mr Gladstone lead the House, as Sir James Graham
was the same age and political standing with Lord Palmerston,
but at once cheerfully contented to waive all his claims in favour
of Mr Gladstone.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Vienna</span>, <i>28th April 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Cousin</span>,&mdash;Before leaving this place I think it right
that I should once more trouble you with a letter, to inform<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA</span>
you that the messenger has arrived who brought your autograph
letter for the Emperor, which I presented to him to-day at an
audience I had for this purpose.... I had a very long and most
interesting conversation with the Emperor, who opened frankly
and fairly upon the great questions of the day. The impression
he made upon me was an excellent one, his confidence and
frankness are complete, and I have the firm conviction that
he is a man of his word, and that he never would say a thing
that he did not in his heart mean. The result of what he said
was the following: that he naturally was most distressed at all
that had occurred; that he was placed by the Emperor of
Russia in a most difficult position; that he quite disapproved
his acts; but that he could not but have a great disinclination
to break with a very old ally; and that even still he hoped this
painful step might be spared to him by the Emperor of Russia
making some proposal so honourable to all parties, that it would
not be rejected by the Western Powers, who would naturally
not be disinclined to a peace, honourable to themselves and
tranquillising for the future; that the basis of such treaty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.25" id="pageiii.25"></a>[page&nbsp;25]</span>
would be the position of the Christian population of the East;
that this might be discussed in Conference, the Russians having
<i>first</i> evacuated the Principalities, upon which the Turks would
hold the right bank of the Danube, our Fleets to await events
in the Bosphorus, and our armies at Constantinople, such position
being highly honourable and advantageous to us in the
eyes of Europe, and certainly not nearly so favourable to
Russia; that he was certainly sensible that the English Government
had not pressed him, feeling as they had done the extreme
delicacy of his position, and the great extent of his frontier so
easily attacked; that he did not wish to say now, till the
moment of decision came, thinking it more honourable and
straightforward not to raise false expectations, but that his
interests being so completely with us, should the Emperor of
Russia do nothing in the honourable direction he hoped to see
him adopt, he should then consider himself called upon to
express frankly to us what he proposed to do, in order that our
action might become united and of advantage to one another.
He further thought that the treaty with Prussia would greatly
facilitate all this, as Prussia had acceded to the wishes of Austria
in the event of certain eventualities, which, however, for
the moment are not named, but which, as far as I understand,
go to the length of leaving Austria unfettered to act as she likes
at the moment when she considers her so doing essential to her
position as a young Empire. It is quite evident to me that this
is the general feeling here, amongst all those who have any
weight in the councils of the Empire. These are <i>Austrian</i> views,
and I must say I can understand them and appreciate them as
such. I am confident, I am certain, they are <i>honest</i> on the part
of the Emperor, and I doubt not he will carry them through to
the letter, for I am confident the Emperor never would say
what he did not mean. Rely upon it, this Country will never
go with Russia; she knows her interests too well for that; she
would like to avoid a War altogether if she could, and with that
view she would be delighted to see some honourable and acceptable
proposal made, but should this fail she will then take a
very decided line, and that line will be in accordance with
Austrian interests&mdash;which means with us. I find that most of
the more prudent people, and many of those in high office, are
fully alive to the advantages of the English alliance, and would
wish to see this alliance confirmed <i>de novo</i>; and I think it would
be very well for us to meet them half-way with this. But then
it would be better to avoid all after-dinner speeches such as
those at the Reform Club,<sup>28</sup> all Polish legions such as are talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.26" id="pageiii.26"></a>[page&nbsp;26]</span>
of, and in short any of these little matters, which are painfully
felt here, and which always produce an uncomfortable and distrustful
effect. The Emperor expressed himself in the most
grateful manner towards yourself, and I think is pleased at your
having permitted me to be present on this occasion.... Hoping
that you will approve of my humble endeavours here, and with
sincere regards to Albert, I beg to remain, my dear Cousin,
your most dutiful Cousin,</p>

a bad fit of the gout&mdash;most miserable to see in every respect.
The Sultan<a id="footnotetagXXIII31" name="footnotetagXXIII31"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIII31"><sup>31</sup></a> received me at once on the day of arrival, and
made his return visit to me yesterday. I confess I was not
much impressed with either his appearance or general ability.
He is, to say the truth, a wretched creature, prematurely aged,
and having nothing whatever to say for himself. A few commonplace
civilities was all the conversation which passed
between us. I said everything I could think of to make a
conversation, among other things messages of civility from
yourself; but though he appeared pleased and expressed his
satisfaction at our being here, I could not get him to enter into
anything, and I was not sorry on both occasions when our interview
was at an end. As to his Ministers, and in fact the whole
population and country, with the exception of Redschid Pasha,<a id="footnotetagXXIII32" name="footnotetagXXIII32"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIII32"><sup>32</sup></a>
they are all a most wretched and miserable set of people, and
far, far worse than anything I could possibly have imagined or
supposed. In fact, the "sick man" is <i>excessively sick indeed</i>,
dying as fast as possible; and the sooner diplomacy disposes
of him the better, for no earthly power can save him, that is
very evident. This is the opinion of every person out here of
both armies, French and English, and you may rest assured
it is the truth. The great thing is that we are here and no other
Power can now step in, but diplomacy must settle what is to
happen, for as to the Turks remaining in Europe that is out
of the question, and the very fact of our being here now has
given them their death-blow. I hope, my dear cousin, you
will forgive me for being very candid on this point, but I really
do not think that anybody in England had any idea of the real
state of affairs here. The sooner therefore that they are put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.28" id="pageiii.28"></a>[page&nbsp;28]</span>
in possession of the truth unvarnished the better. The great
and imperative necessity is that the four Powers of Europe
should strike together, otherwise things will become much
worse than they are even at present. Everybody is very civil
and obliging to me, the Sultan has put me into one of his best
Palaces, very nicely fitted up, and is anxious to do everything
I wish. I find it inconvenient, as the troops are on the other
side of the Bosphorus, and I therefore intend going over there
to reside if possible. Marshal St Arnaud is here and Prince
Napoleon, but no French troops. I have seen the latter once;
he was very civil indeed to me, but I do not think he has made
at all a good impression here, his manner being offensive and
harsh. I do not think the Army like him at all. I am afraid
the French Ambassador is giving much trouble. Neither St
Arnaud nor the Prince like him at all, and I believe they have
written to demand his recall, which would be a very good thing,
as he cannot hit it off with anybody. As to our movements,
I know nothing of them as yet, nor do I think that much has
as yet been settled, but I fear we shall not be fit to move for
some time; the difficulty of transport is very great, our Artillery
only partly arrived, and no Cavalry. We require more
troops, more particularly of the latter arm, in which the Russians
are very strong. We ought to have at least 10,000 men
more, and the sooner they are sent out the better. Even that
number is not enough, for the French talk of 100,000 men, and
we should be in a most dreadful minority unless we had 40,000
to 50,000. I am afraid all this will alarm people in England,
but it is the truth.... I remain, my dear Cousin, your most
dutiful Cousin,</p>

terribly criticised and derided as "vacillating," has been, since
the beginning of this most inauspicious conflict, one and the
same, and <i>without a hairsbreadth of deviation</i> either to the right
or to the left. As it rests on the unshakable foundation which
my conscience as a King and a Christian has laid down, and
which does not admit <i>que je fasse la besogne ni de l'un ni de</i>

<i>l'autre parti</i>, I am abused and insulted at the Winter Palace,
and regarded, by way of contrast in London and Paris, as a kind
of simpleton&mdash;neither of which is pleasant.</p>

<p class="ind">May your Majesty believe my Royal Word: I was, I am,
I remain the truest and most faithful friend of Great Britain,
as well in principle as from religious feeling and from true affection.
I desire and practise a good and honest understanding
with France; but when it comes to helping the French&mdash;to
whom Prussia's geographical position between Paris and Warsaw
is very inconvenient&mdash;to pull the <i>chestnuts from the fire</i> for
them, for such a task I am frankly too good. If the Emperor
wishes to force me to assist&mdash;as evidently he is inclined to do&mdash;it
will end by becoming too difficult for him. He ought to
thank God that my view of Russian policy and my fidelity to
your Majesty have prevented me from making him begin this
<i>Turkish</i> War on the <i>other side of his own frontier</i>. The great
advantage of this result is totally forgotten in France, and,
unfortunately, in England too. Those who every day fill the
papers of home and foreign countries with accounts of my
vacillations, nay, who represent me as leaping from my own
horse on to a Russian one, are inventing lies, in a great measure,
deliberately. I tell your Majesty, on my honour and conscience,
that my policy is to-day <i>the same</i> as it was nine months
ago. I have recognised it as my duty before God to preserve,
for my people and my provinces, peace, <i>because I recognise
Peace as a blessing and War as a curse</i>. I cannot and will not
side with Russia, because Russia's arrogance and wickedness
have caused this <i>horrible</i> trouble, and because duty and conscience
and tradition forbid me to draw the sword against Old
England. In the same degree duty and conscience forbid me
to make unprovoked war against Russia, because Russia, so
far, has done me no harm. So I thought, so I willed when I
thought myself isolated. How then could I now suddenly
abandon a steady policy, preserved in the face of many dangers,
and incline to Russia at the moment when I have concluded
with Austria an Alliance defensive and offensive, in which (if
God grant His blessing) the whole of Germany will join in a few
days, thus welding, for the entire duration of the War, the
whole of Central Europe into a Unity, comprising 72,000,000
people, and easily able to put 1,000,000 men into the field?
And yet, most gracious Queen, I do not take up a defiant position
on the strength of this enormous power, but I trust in the
Lord's help and my own sacred Right; I also believe, honestly
and firmly, that the character of a so-called Great Power must
justify itself, <i>not by swimming with the current</i>, but <i>by standing
firm like a rock in the sea</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">I close this letter which, in consequence of various interruptions,
is almost a week old, on the 24th of May. This is
your birthday, ever dearest, most gracious Queen. On this
day I lay at your Majesty's feet the expression of my wishes
for every blessing. May God grant your Majesty a joyful
day, and a richly blessed year of rule. May He strengthen,
preserve, and invigorate your precious health, and may He
give you, within the three hundred and sixty-five days of the

graciously to keep it secret, communicating it only to the dear
Prince. It is a matter of course that the facts which it contains,
and the resulting explanations, which may be of importance

whether he has received the supreme command over the

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Dearest Sir and Brother</span>,&mdash;Your faithful Bunsen has
handed me your Majesty's long explanatory letter, and has
taken his leave of us,<a id="footnotetagXXIII35" name="footnotetagXXIII35"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIII35"><sup>35</sup></a> with tears in his eyes, and I can assure
your Majesty that I, too, see with pain the departure of one
whom I have been accustomed to consider as the faithful mirror
of your feelings, wishes, and views, and whose depth and
warmth of heart I esteem no less highly than his high mental
gifts. Sympathy with his fate is general here. I entirely
recognise in your letter the expression of your friendship, which
is so dear to me, and which does not admit any sort of misunderstanding
to exist between us, without my endeavouring
at once to clear it up and remove it. How could I meet your
friendship otherwise than by equally absolute frankness,
allowing you to look into my inmost heart! Though you have
shown me a proof of your gracious confidence in giving me,
down to the smallest detail, an account of your personal and
business relations with your servants, I still believe that I
have no right to formulate any judgment. Only one thing
my heart bids me to express, viz., that the men with whom you
have broken were faithful, veracious servants, warmly devoted
to you, and that just by the freedom and independence of
spirit, with which they have expressed their opinions to your
Majesty, <i>they have given an indisputable proof</i> of having had in
view, not their own personal advantage and the favour of their
Sovereign, but his true interests and welfare alone; and if
just such men as these&mdash;among them even your loving brother,
a thoroughly noble and chivalrous Prince, standing next to
the throne&mdash;find themselves forced, in a grave crisis, to turn
away from you, this is a <i>momentous sign</i>, which might well give
cause to your Majesty to take counsel with yourself, and to
examine with anxious care, whether perhaps the hidden cause
of past and future evils may not lie in your Majesty's own
views?<a id="footnotetagXXIII36" name="footnotetagXXIII36"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIII36"><sup>36</sup></a> You complain, most honoured Sire and Brother,
that your policy is blamed as <i>vacillating</i>, and that your own
person is insulted at home and abroad (a thing which has often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.32" id="pageiii.32"></a>[page&nbsp;32]</span>
filled me with <i>deep grief and indignation</i>), and you asseverate
that your policy rests upon a firm basis, which the conscience
of "a King and a Christian has laid down for it." But
should it be possible to discover in your Majesty's fundamental
views something self-contradictory, then necessarily,
the more consistently and conscientiously these fundamental
views are revealed in their consequences, the more contradictory
must your actions appear to those who are not intimately aware
of your intentions, and cannot but force upon the world
the impression that your views themselves were wavering.</p>

<p class="ind">You will not take it amiss in a true friend and sister, if she
endeavours to place before you her impressions on this matter,
as frankly as they appear to her.</p>
<span class="rightnote">INVASION OF THE PRINCIPALITIES</span>
<p class="ind">Your Majesty has acknowledged in the face of the world
that Russia has addressed to the Porte demands which she had
no right to make. You have further acknowledged that the
forcible taking possession of two Turkish provinces with the
intention of enforcing the demand was a political wrong.
You have, together with Austria, France, and England, several
times declared in Protocols the preservation of the integrity
of the Turkish empire to be a European interest. Notwithstanding
all this, Russia continues to occupy the Danube
principalities, penetrates further into Turkey, and, by forcing
on a sanguinary and exhausting war, leads the unhappy and
<i>suffering</i> empire on to the brink of the grave. What should
Europe then do under these circumstances?</p>

<p class="ind">It could not possibly be the intention of the Powers to declare
the preservation and integrity of the Porte to be a matter of
European concern, solely in order to allow that empire to be
destroyed before their very eyes! As to Prussia, I can conceive
a line of policy, not that indeed which I should think in
harmony with the generosity and chivalry of your rule, but
still one possible in itself, by which she would say to herself:
"The preservation of this integrity I have indeed declared to
be a matter of European concern, but I wish to leave England
and France to defend that policy with their wealth and blood,
and reserve to myself only a <i>moral</i> co-operation." But what
am I to think if, after England and France with courageous
readiness have taken upon themselves alone this immense
responsibility, sacrifice, and danger, your Majesty is now
mainly considering the erection of a barrier of 72,000,000 of
men between them and that Power, against whose encroachment
the European interest is to be defended? What am I
to say to the threat uttered against the <i>West</i> as well as against
the <i>East?</i> and to your even asking from the West gratitude
for "the enormous advantage" that you do not, into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.33" id="pageiii.33"></a>[page&nbsp;33]</span>
bargain, yourself join in attacking it!! For your Majesty
says expressly in your letter: "The Emperor ought to thank
God that my view of Russian policy, my <i>fidelity</i> to your Majesty,
have prevented me from making him begin the Turkish war
on the other side of his own frontier. The enormous advantage
of this abstention is totally forgotten in France, and,
unfortunately, in England too!"</p>

<p class="ind">Dearest Sir and Brother, this language shows a contradiction
in your own mind, which fills me with the greatest anxiety for
possible consequences, an anxiety not diminished by your
kindly adding: "Duty, Conscience, and Tradition forbid you
to draw the sword against Old England."</p>

<p class="ind">I shall gladly with you bless the day on which the word of
Peace can be uttered. Your Majesty can, by vigorous co-operation,
help to usher in that day, just as you might have&mdash;in
my conviction&mdash;contributed, by vigorous co-operation to
prevent the War altogether.</p>
<span class="rightnote">FRIENDLY RELATIONS</span>
<p class="ind">Whatever these troublous times may bring us, I harbour the
firm confidence that the warmth of our friendly relations cannot

matter, so entirely in harmony with the interests of the two

<span class="rightnote">THE WAR OFFICE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>8th June 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen had an Audience to-day before the Council,
and represented that what was intended was merely a division
of the office of Secretary of State, and not the creation of any
new power, and must be considered rather as a means of
avoiding further changes.<sup>37</sup> Lord Grey, in hearing of this
intention, called it in a letter "the worst arrangement of all,"
as unfavourable to his further views; the Duke of Newcastle
would fill the office, and would have to prepare the changes,
inherent in the arrangement, and was determined not to break
down the present arrangements; Lord John Russell was
agreed herewith, and Sir George Grey would take office knowing
this to be Lord Aberdeen's firm decision. But there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.34" id="pageiii.34"></a>[page&nbsp;34]</span>
in fact no choice. Mr Rich would this afternoon bring forward
a Motion in the House of Commons for the consolidation of all
military offices under one Department and a Civil Head, and
Lord John Russell, to whom Lord Aberdeen had said that the
Queen still hesitated about admitting the separation of the
duties of Secretary of State, declared to him angrily, if that
was so, he would go down to the House and vote for Mr Rich's
Motion!! The Motion would be carried without fail in the
House.</p>

<p class="ind">So this important measure had been carried by storm (as
the Queen could only give way under these circumstances),
and carried without a definite plan, leaving everything to the
future!!</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John is to be Lord President, and he insisted upon Sir
George Grey taking the Colonies. Lord Aberdeen fears much
dissatisfaction from Lord Canning, Mr Cardwell, and Mr
Peel, and just dissatisfaction; the Cabinet are very angry at
the whole proceeding. Lord Granville behaved exceedingly
well, putting himself and his office entirely at Lord Aberdeen's
disposal.<sup>38</sup></p>

<p class="ind">It is supposed that in the House expressions will be dropped
in favour of Lord Palmerston's taking the conduct of the War
in his hands. The Duke of Newcastle, whom we saw, also
states the extreme difficulty of <i>defining</i> the duties of the
Secretary of State, but promises to do so, as far as possible,
for the Queen's convenience.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Albert</span>.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 37: Lord John Russell had some time before proposed the separation of the War and
Colonial Departments, with a view of filling the Colonial Office himself, "which, in every
point of view." wrote Lord Aberdeen to the Queen, "would have been a most satisfactory
arrangement."</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 38: Lord Fitzmaurice, in his <i>Life of Lord Granville</i>, points out that Mr Strutt was really
the person who had a right to complain. He was abruptly removed from the Chancellorship
of the Duchy, and replaced by Lord Granville to suit Lord John's convenience.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>26th June 1851.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has not yet acknowledged Lord Aberdeen's
letter of the 24th. She is very glad to hear that he will take
an opportunity to-day of dispelling misapprehensions which
have arisen in the public mind in consequence of his last speech
in the House of Lords, and the effect of which has given the
Queen very great uneasiness.<sup>39</sup> She knows Lord Aberdeen
so well that she can fully enter into his feelings and understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.35" id="pageiii.35"></a>[page&nbsp;35]</span>
what he means, but the public, particularly under strong excitement
of patriotic feeling, is impatient and annoyed to hear
at this moment the first Minister of the Crown enter into an
<i>impartial</i> examination of the Emperor of Russia's character
and conduct. The qualities in Lord Aberdeen's character
which the Queen values most highly, his candour and his
courage in expressing opinions even if opposed to general
feelings of the moment, are in this instance dangerous to him,
and the Queen hopes that in the vindication of his own conduct
to-day, which ought to be triumphant, as it wants in fact <i>no</i>
vindication, he will not undertake the ungrateful and injurious
task of vindicating the Emperor of Russia from any of the
exaggerated charges brought against him and his policy at a
time when there is enough in it to make us fight with all might
against it.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 39: The speech of Lord Aberdeen, to which the Queen here refers, had created a very
unsatisfactory impression. On the 19th of June the venerable Lord Lyndhurst had
denounced the aggressive policy and the perfidy of Russia; in the debate which followed,
Lord Aberdeen spoke coldly, in a strain of semi-apology for Russia, and with an unlucky
reference to the Treaty of Adrianople. Popular feeling against Russia being then at a
white heat, the speech was considered indicative of apathy on behalf of the Government
in the prosecution of the war. Accordingly, by moving on a later day for a copy of his
own despatch of 1829, relative to the Treaty, the Premier obtained an opportunity of
dispelling some of the apprehensions which his speech had excited.

<p class="ind">The Queen observes in Lord Cowley's letter a suggestion of
M. Drouyn de Lhuys to stop, if possible, the Russian Loan.
She thinks this of the highest importance as <i>cutting</i> the <i>sinews</i>
of war of the enemy. The Queen does not know whether we
have by law the power to forbid the quotation of this stock in
our market, but a short Act of Parliament might be obtained
for the purpose. The London and Paris markets rejecting
such paper would have the greatest influence upon its issue.<sup>40</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 40: Lord Clarendon replied:&mdash;"... With reference to your Majesty's note of this

<span class="rightnote">INSTRUCTIONS TO LORD RAGLAN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>29th June 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
The Cabinet assembled yesterday evening at Lord John
Russell's, at Richmond, and continued to a very late hour.<sup>41</sup></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.36" id="pageiii.36"></a>[page&nbsp;36]</span>

<p class="ind">A Draft of Instructions to Lord Raglan had been prepared by
the Duke of Newcastle, in which the necessity of a prompt
attack upon Sebastopol and the Russian Fleet was strongly
urged. The amount of force now assembled at Varna,
and in the neighbourhood, appeared to be amply sufficient
to justify such an enterprise, with the assistance of the English
and French Fleets. But although the expedition to the Crimea
was pressed very warmly, and recommended to be undertaken
with the least possible delay, the final decision was left
to the judgment and discretion of Lord Raglan and Marshal
St Arnaud, after they should have communicated with Omar
Pasha.</p>

<p class="ind">It was also decided to send the reserve force, now in England,
of 5,000 men, to join Lord Raglan without delay. This will
exhaust the whole disposable force of the country at this time,
and renders it impossible to supply British troops for any undertaking
in the Baltic. A communication was therefore made
yesterday to the French Government to know whether they
would be disposed to send 6,000 French troops, to be conveyed
in English transports, to the Baltic, in order to join in an
attack upon the Aland Islands,<sup>42</sup> which appeared to be attended
with no great difficulty; although any attempt upon Helsingfors,
or Cronstadt, was pronounced by Sir Charles Napier
to be hopeless.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Kinglake describes, in an interesting passage, the growth in the public mind of a
determination that the Crimea should be invaded, and Sebastopol destroyed. The
Emperor Napoleon had suggested the plan at an earlier stage, and the <i>Times</i> newspaper
fanned popular enthusiasm in favour of it. The improved outlook in the East warranted
the attempt being made, but the plan was not regarded with unqualified approval by the
commanders of the allied forces in the East. In the speech, already referred to, of Lord
Lyndhurst, the project had been urged upon the Government, and Lord Raglan considered
that the despatch now sanctioned by the Cabinet, which is printed in the <i>Invasion of the
Crimea</i>, left him no discretion in the matter.</p>

<p class="ind">The scheme had previously been considered in all its aspects by the Cabinet, and Mr
Kinglake gives an exaggerated importance to the fact that some of the members of the
Cabinet gave way to sleep while the long draft of instructions was being read to them
at the after-dinner Council at Pembroke Lodge.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 41: The war now entered upon a new phase. Though the land forces of the Allies had
hitherto not come into conflict with the enemy, the Turks under Omar Pasha had been
unexpectedly successful in their resistance to the Russians, whom a little later they
decisively defeated at Giurgevo. Silistria had been determinedly besieged by the Russians,
and its fall was daily expected. Yet, under the leadership of three young Englishmen,
Captain Butler and Lieutenants Nasmyth and Ballard, the Russians were beaten off and
the siege raised. The schemes of the Czar against Turkey in Europe had miscarried.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 42: Bomarsund, a fortress on one of these islands, was taken by Sir Charles Napier, aided
by a French contingent under General Baraguay d'Hilliers, on the 16th of August; but
the high expectations raised as to the success of the operations in the Baltic were not
realised.

<p class="ind">In consequence of the departure of these additional 5,000
men for the East, the Queen feels very uneasy at the very
defenceless state in which the country will be left, not from
any want of confidence arising from the present conjuncture
of affairs, but from a strong sense of the impolicy and danger of
leaving this great country in such a helpless state under any
circumstances, for we never can foresee what events may not
suddenly spring up at any moment (like Greece, for instance<sup>43</sup>)
which may require a force to be in readiness for any particular
purpose.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen therefore wishes the Duke of Newcastle to give
her detailed answers upon the various points stated in the accompanying
paper; but the Queen wishes to have the "<i>effective</i>
state" and not "the state upon paper only." The Duke
will be able to obtain these reports from the different departments.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen approves the enclosed drafts, and wishes only to
remark on one passage, where Lord Clarendon says, "that he
acts by the unanimous desire of the Cabinet," which she thinks
better altered or omitted. If left, it might weaken the authority
of future instructions emanating from the Secretary of State

<p class="ind">The Queen has just received Lord Aberdeen's letter, and has
fully considered the contents of it. She has finally decided to
make no change in her intended departure, from a conviction
that her doing so might shake confidence in the result of this
night's Debate. Should anything serious occur, she would be
ready to return to-morrow or at any time that her presence in
town was considered of importance to the public service.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>19th July 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday,
and was very glad to hear that both the meeting and
the Debate went off so well. The party which supports the
Government is certainly "a strange basis for a Government to
rest upon," but such as it is we must make the best of it, and
nothing will contribute more to keeping it together than to give
it the impression that the Government is thoroughly united.<sup>44</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 44: During a desultory discussion on the 13th of July, Mr Disraeli had assailed the Government
and its chief in the Commons, to such purpose that Lord John Russell, stung by
his sarcasms, and mortified by his own failure, asked Lord Aberdeen to relieve him of the
Leadership of the House. The Queen, to whom he had also written, entreated Lord
John not to let his opponent see that his object in making his attack had been successful.
A meeting of the Ministerialists was held on the 17th at the Foreign Office, at which one
hundred and eighty members of the House of Commons were present, and some diversity
of opinion was expressed; the result of the meeting was that the Government was more
satisfactorily supported.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>26th July 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">It is a very long time since the Queen has had the pleasure
of hearing from Lord Dalhousie, but she supposes that (fortunately)
there is very little to say, everything being so quiet and
prosperous. The Queen highly appreciates and values Lord
Dalhousie's kind offer to remain in India while there is any
prospect of difficulty being caused by the present War, which
will be a source of great satisfaction and tranquillity to her,
as she feels that her Indian Dominions cannot be in safer
hands.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes to tell Lord Dalhousie how much interested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.39" id="pageiii.39"></a>[page&nbsp;39]</span>
and pleased we have been in making the acquaintance of
the young Maharajah Dhuleep Singh.<sup>45</sup> It is not without
mixed feelings of pain and sympathy that the Queen sees this
young Prince, once destined to so high and powerful a position,
and now reduced to so dependent a one by her arms; his
youth, amiable character, and striking good looks, as well as his
being a Christian, the first of his high rank who has embraced
our faith, must incline every one favourably towards him, and
it will be a pleasure to us to do all we can to be of use to him,
and to befriend and protect him.</p>

<p class="ind">It also interested us to see poor old Prince Gholam Mohammed,
the last son of the once so dreaded Tippoo Sahib.</p>

<p class="ind">We both hope that Lord Dalhousie's health is good, and the
Prince sends him his kind remembrance.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 45: This young Prince was born in 1838, and was a younger son of Runjeet Singh, Chief
of the Sikhs, who, after a loyal alliance with England for thirty years, died in 1839. In
1843 Dhuleep Singh was raised to the throne, which had been occupied successively by
Runjeet's elder sons. After the Sikh war in 1845, the British Government gave to the
boy-king the support of a British force. In 1849, after the destruction of the Sikh army
at Gujerat, and the annexation of the Punjab, a pension was bestowed on the young
Maharajah on condition of his remaining loyal to the British Government. He became
a Christian and was at this time on a visit to England.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>6th August 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Hardinge's letter of the 4th.<sup>46</sup>
She would for the future wish all papers for signature to
be accompanied by a descriptive list showing at a glance the
purport of the documents, as is done with papers from other
Government offices.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has looked over the lists of Major-Generals made
by the last brevet which Lord Hardinge submitted, and must
confess that it does not afford a great choice; yet, leaving out
the cavalry officers and those disqualified by age or infirmities,
there remain some few whom she has marked with an "X," for
whose exclusion no adequate reason is apparent. An exclusion
of officers who have served in the Guards, <i>merely on that account</i>,
the Queen would not wish to see adopted as a principle, and
the selection of Colonels of the Line (because there are no
Generals fit), in preference to Generals of the Guards who are
perfectly so, will amount to this. General Eden,<sup>47</sup> moreover,
has been in command of a Regiment of the Line, and General
Knollys<sup>48</sup> has not been promoted from the Guards, and, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.40" id="pageiii.40"></a>[page&nbsp;40]</span>
accepting the Governorship of Guernsey, specially begged that
this might not exclude him from active service&mdash;a circumstance
which he mentioned to the Prince at the time. Both these have
the reputation of very good officers.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen does not wish anything to be arranged prospectively
now, but would recommend the subject to Lord
Hardinge's future consideration.</p>

<span class="rightnote">SPECIAL PRAYERS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>21st August 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must repeat what she has frequently done, that
she strongly objects to these <i>special</i> prayers which <i>are</i>, in fact,
<i>not</i> a sign of gratitude or confidence in the Almighty&mdash;for if this
is the course to be pursued, we <i>ought</i> to have one for every
<i>illness</i>,
and certainly in '37 the influenza was notoriously more
<i>fatal</i> than the cholera had ever been, and <i>yet no one</i> would have
thought of having a prayer against <i>that</i>. Our Liturgy <i>has</i>
provided for these calamities, and we may have frequent
returns of the cholera&mdash;and yet it would be difficult to <i>define</i>
the <i>number</i> of deaths which are to <i>make</i> "a form of prayer"
<i>necessary</i>. The Queen would, therefore, strongly recommend
the usual prayer being used, and no other, as is the case for the
prayer in time of War. What is the use of the prayers in the
Liturgy, which were no doubt composed when we were subject
to other equally fatal diseases, if a new one is always to be
framed specially for the cholera?</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen would wish Lord Aberdeen to give this as her
decided opinion to the Archbishop, at all events, for the
present. Last year the cholera quite decimated Newcastle,
and was bad in many other places, but there was <i>no special</i>
prayer, and <i>now</i> the illness is in <i>London</i> but <i>not</i> in any
other
place, a prayer is proposed by the Archbishop. The Queen
cannot see the difference between the one and the other.</p>

<span class="rightnote">CIVIL LIST PENSIONS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>1st September 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen, with his humble duty, begs to lay before
your Majesty the pensions proposed to be granted on the Civil
List at this time. The only case requiring any special remark
is that of the children of Lord Nelson's adopted daughter.
There seems little doubt that the person referred to was really
Lord Nelson's daughter, according to evidence recently produced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.41" id="pageiii.41"></a>[page&nbsp;41]</span>
and was recommended by him to the care of the country,
just before the battle of Trafalgar.<sup>49</sup></p>

<p class="ind">A numerous party in the House of Commons wished that
your Majesty's Government should propose a special vote for
this person and her family; but the Cabinet thought that it
would give rise to much scandal and disagreeable debate, and
finally recommended Lord Aberdeen to place the three daughters
on the Pension List. The circumstances of the case are,
no doubt, very peculiar; and although Lord Aberdeen does
not feel perfectly satisfied with the course pursued, he thinks
it very desirable to avoid the sort of Parliamentary debates
to which the discussion of such a subject would necessarily give
rise.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 49: Horatia, daughter of Nelson and Lady Hamilton, was born on the 29th of January

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 50: The French Emperor had established a camp between Boulogne and St Omer, and
early in the summer had invited Prince Albert to visit him. It was reasonably conjectured
at the time that one of the chief purposes of the invitation was by personal intercourse
to overcome the prejudice which the Emperor believed prevailed against him. The
visit lasted from the 4th till the 8th of September, and the Prince's impressions were
recorded in a memorandum, "the value of which," writes Sir Theodore Martin, by way of
preface to his publication of it, "cannot be overstated; nor is it less valuable for the light
which it throws upon the Prince's character, by the remarkable contrasts between himself
and the Emperor of the French, which were elicited in the unreserved discussions which
each seems equally to have courted."

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Foreign Office</span>, <i>22nd September 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty....</p>

<p class="ind">Count Walewski told Lord Clarendon to-day that the Emperor
had spoken with enthusiasm of the Prince, saying that
in all his experience he had never met with a person possessing
such various and profound knowledge, or who communicated
it with the same frankness. His Majesty added that he had
never learned so much in a short time, and was grateful. He
began his conversation with reproaching Count Walewski for
not having written to him much oftener respecting the Prince,
and endeavoured to ascertain the opinions of His Royal Highness
upon all important subjects.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the invitation, the Emperor's account of it
to Count Walewski was that he had apologised to the Prince
for the bad reception he had given His Royal Highness, and
expressed a hope that he might have an opportunity of <i>doing
better</i> at Paris, if your Majesty and the Prince would honour him
with a visit; and that His Royal Highness had then said, "the
Queen hopes to see your Majesty at Windsor, and will be happy
to make acquaintance with the Empress." The Emperor,
however, had only taken this as a courteous return to his invitation,
and not as intended for a positive invitation.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon told Count Walewski that he believed the
matter had passed inversely, and that the Prince had first
communicated your Majesty's message.</p>

<p class="ind">Be that as it may, Count Walewski said the Emperor will be
delighted to avail himself of the Queen's gracious kindness;
nothing will give him so much pleasure....</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR'S VISIT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Balmoral</span>, <i>24th September 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the two letters from Lord Cowley. She
is very sorry to see doubts arise as to the correctness of the
intelligence about the safe debarkation of our whole expeditionary
force in the Crimea, but still clings to the hope of its being
true.</p>

<p class="ind">Count Walewski's account of the Emperor's version of his
conversation with the Prince explains what the Prince suspected
at one time himself, that the Emperor had not understood
the Prince's remark as conveying a <i>direct</i> invitation, but
merely as a general term of civility. What the Prince intended
to convey was something between the two, making it clear that
he would be well received, and leaving it entirely open to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.43" id="pageiii.43"></a>[page&nbsp;43]</span>
to come or not according to his own political views and circumstances.
This appeared to the Prince the most polite and
delicate, preventing all appearance as if a counter-visit for
his own at Boulogne was expected. Lest the Emperor should
not have rightly understood the Prince, he repeated the
wish to see the Emperor in England, and the hope of the
Queen to make the Empress's acquaintance also, <i>more
directly</i> to Marshal Vaillant, who gave the same answer as
the Emperor had done&mdash;he hoped we should come to Paris
in return.</p>

<p class="ind">Matters stand as well as possible with regard to the visit;
in the Queen's opinion, the Emperor can come if he likes, and if
prevented, is bound to nothing. Should he ask when his visit
would be most agreeable to the Queen, the middle of November
would be the time.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Balmoral</span>, <i>30th September 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the enclosed letters. The French show
their usual vivacity in pressing so hard for decision upon what
is to be done with Sebastopol when taken.<sup>51</sup> Surely we ought
to have taken it first before we can dispose of it, and everything
as to the decision about it must depend upon the state in which
we receive it, and the opinion of the Military and Naval Commanders
after they find themselves in possession of it. The
Queen hopes, therefore, that Lord Clarendon will succeed in
restraining French impatience as he has often done before.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 51: Lord Clarendon had given the Queen the two reasons for which the French were
pressing, in anticipation, the retention of the Crimea, viz. as affording suitable winter
quarters, and as a guarantee in case of peace negotiations. On the 7th of September
the allied forces had sailed for the Crimea; on the 21st the Queen learned by telegram
that 25,000 English, 25,000 French, and 8,000 Turks had landed safely without encountering
resistance, and begun the march to Sebastopol. The Queen, with her usual kindly
solicitude for the health and comfort of her Ministers, had summoned Lord Aberdeen from
London to have the benefit of the Scotch air; he remained at Balmoral from the 27th till
the 30th, when he went to his own house at Haddo. Immediately after his departure, a
telegram arrived from Lord Clarendon announcing the victory of the Alma.

He had the honour of receiving your Majesty's box this morning

evening.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.44" id="pageiii.44"></a>[page&nbsp;44]</span>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen humbly presumes to offer his most cordial
congratulations to your Majesty on the great intelligence received
by telegraph this morning. The account sent by Lord
Stratford of the victory on the Alma must be correct; the
report mentioned by Mr Colquhoun<sup>52</sup> may possibly be so too.
At all events, we may fairly hope that the fall of Sebastopol
cannot long be delayed.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen has written to Lord Clarendon this morning
on the subject of the fortifications of Sebastopol, which although,
somewhat embarrassing at the moment, is not attended with
any great practical importance.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen regrets that the speedy return of the post
prevents him from sending your Majesty a copy of his letter,
which in substance, however, was to the following effect.
Without attaching any undue importance to the decision, he
was inclined to adhere to his first proposition of the immediate
and entire destruction of the works. He did not see the
advantage of doing the thing by halves; while the destruction
of the sea defences only might give rise to erroneous impressions
and would be of an equivocal character. The fall of Sebastopol
would in fact be the conquest of the Crimea, and the Allies
might winter there with perfect security, as, by occupying the
lines of Perekop,<sup>53</sup> any access to the Crimea would effectually
be prevented by land. Lord Aberdeen thought that with a
view to peace, and the restitution of the Crimea to Russia, it
would be more easy for the Emperor to accept the destruction
of the fortifications when accomplished, than to agree to any
stipulation having such an object.</p>

<p class="ind">On the whole, Lord Aberdeen was inclined to think that if
the place should not be at once destroyed, it might be better
to preserve it in its present state, until the matter should be
further considered. The Allies would always have it in their
power to act as they thought best, and the question might in
some degree be affected by future events. The great objection
to leaving the matter undecided for the present appeared
to be from the possibility of differences hereafter between
France and England upon the subject. After the astounding
proposition made to Lord Raglan by the French Generals
when actually embarked and at sea, it would be well to
leave nothing in doubt. The Turks, too, might perhaps
desire to have a voice in the matter, and might become
troublesome....</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General presents his most humble duty to
your Majesty, and begs to offer his respectful thanks for the
very gracious manner in which your Majesty has been pleased
to acknowledge the offer he has made to retain still the Government
of India during the ensuing year.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General does not affect to say that he makes
no sacrifice in so doing. Many things unite to warn him that
it is time he were gone: and his family circumstances, in
which your Majesty has long shown so gracious an interest, have
rendered the prospect of his remaining longer absent from
England a source of much anxiety and perplexity to him.
But he felt that this was no time for any man, high or low,
to leave his post. And as a seven-years' experience must needs
have rendered him more capable of immediate usefulness than
any other, though a far abler man, without such experience
could possibly be, he did not hesitate to offer the continued
service which your Majesty might most justly expect, and
which he is proud to render cheerfully.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty's remark on the absence of any letter from
the Governor-General of late would have disquieted him with
apprehensions that he had been thought neglectful, but that
your Majesty at the same time ascribed the silence to its real
cause. Since the announcement of the termination of the
Burmese War there has, in truth, been no occurrence which,
of itself, seemed worthy of being made the subject of a report
to your Majesty. India has been tranquil in all her borders.
And although no event could well be more gratifying than this
continuous tranquillity was in itself, still the periodical report
of peace and quiet on all sides seemed likely to be as uninteresting
as the monotonous, though satisfactory, "All's
well" of a ring of sentries.</p>

<p class="ind">The war in which your Majesty has engaged with that great
Power has not been directly felt in this part of your Majesty's
dominions; but its indirect influence is most sensibly apparent.</p>

<p class="ind">The notions entertained of Russia, and the estimate formed
of her powers, by the nations of India, are exaggerated in
the extreme. Although our pride must wince on hearing
it, it is an unquestionable fact that the general belief in
India at this moment is that Russia gravely menaces the
power of England, and will be more than a match for her
in the end.</p>

<p class="ind">This feeling cannot prudently be disregarded. The Governor-General
need hardly say to your Majesty that he believes that
any direct attack by Russia on these dominions at the present
time is utterly impracticable; and that there is no more risk
of an invasion of India by the Emperor Nicholas than of
another by Mahmood of Ghuznee. Nevertheless, the uneasy
feeling which now prevails among native States and among
ourselves, partly of alarm, partly of indefinite expectation,
ought to be guarded against; and the means of meeting
any difficulties which may arise out of it should be at our
command.</p>

<p class="ind">Earnestly desirous to contribute every possible aid to your
Majesty's arms in the great contest now going on in Europe,
the Governor-General has respectfully placed at the disposal
of your Majesty's Ministers all the four regiments of Royal
Cavalry now serving in India. The Infantry is already hardly
adequate for our own necessities: and while the Governor-General
will be quite ready to accept and to face any additional
responsibilities which he may be called upon to bear, he has
felt it to be his duty to state that, beyond the four regiments
of Cavalry, European troops cannot safely be spared from
India at the present time.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General, however, feels that he is not indulging
in any vain boast when he ventures to assure your
Majesty that, under God's good blessing, these, your Dominions
in the East, are at present absolutely safe.... Your Majesty's
most obedient, most humble, and devoted Subject and Servant,</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Marquis of Dalhousie.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">DEPOSED INDIAN PRINCES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Balmoral</span>, <i>2nd October 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">As the Queen knows that the East India Company are
chiefly guided by Lord Dalhousie's advice with respect to all
Indian affairs in public as well as of a more private nature,
she thinks that she cannot do better than write to him upon a
subject which she <i>feels</i> strongly upon, and which she is sure
that Lord Dalhousie will enter into. It is the position of those
unfortunate Indian Princes who have, either themselves or
their fathers, been for public reasons deposed. Two instances
are now before the Queen's eyes upon which she wishes to
state her opinion.</p>

<p class="ind">The first is old Prince Gholam Mohammed, and his son
Prince Feroz Shah. The Queen understands (though she is
not sure of the fact) that the old man is here in order to try to
obtain his pension continued to his son. This is very natural,
and it strikes the Queen to be an arrangement difficult to be
justified, in a moral point of view, to give these poor people&mdash;who
after <i>all</i> were once so mighty&mdash;<i>no</i> security beyond their
lives. Whilst we remain permanently in possession of their
vast Empire, they receive a pension, which is not <i>even</i> continued
to their descendants. Would it not be much the best
to allow them, instead of a pension, to hold, perhaps under
the Government, a property, which would enable them and
their descendants to live respectably, maintaining a certain
rank and position? The Queen believes that Lord Dalhousie
himself suggested this principle in the case of the Ameers of
Scinde.</p>

<p class="ind">Nothing is more painful for <i>any</i> one than the thought that
their children and grandchildren have no future, and may become
absolutely beggars. How much more <i>dreadful</i> must this
be to proud people, who, like Prince Gholam, are the sons and
grandsons of great Princes like Hyder Ali and Tippoo Sahib!
Besides it strikes the Queen that the more kindly we treat
Indian Princes, whom <i>we</i> have <i>conquered</i>, and the more consideration
we show for their birth and former grandeur, the
more we shall attach Indian Princes and Governments to us,
and the more ready will they be to come under our rule.</p>
<span class="rightnote">MAHARAJAH DHULEEP SINGH</span>
<p class="ind">The second instance is that of the young Maharajah Dhuleep
Singh (and the Queen must here observe that the favourable
opinion she expressed of him, in her last letter to Lord Dalhousie,
has only been confirmed and strengthened by closer
acquaintance). This young Prince has the <i>strongest</i> claims
upon our generosity and sympathy; deposed, for <i>no</i> fault of
his, when a little boy of ten years old, he is as innocent as any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.48" id="pageiii.48"></a>[page&nbsp;48]</span>
private individual of the misdeeds which compelled us to depose
him, and take possession of his territories. He has besides
since become a Christian, whereby he is for ever cut off from
his own people. His case therefore appears to the Queen still
stronger than the <i>former</i> one, as he was not even a conquered
enemy, but merely powerless in the hands of the Sikh soldiery.</p>

<p class="ind">There is something too painful in the idea of a young deposed
Sovereign, once so powerful, receiving a pension, and having
<i>no</i> security that his children and descendants, and these moreover
Christians, should have any home or position.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hears that Lord Dalhousie himself would wish
and advise his pension to be exchanged for a property on which
the Maharajah might live, which he might improve (giving
thereby a most valuable example) and transmit some day to
his descendants, should he have any; she hopes therefore that
this may be so settled, and that he may, on attaining the age of
eighteen, have a comfortable and fitting position worthy his
high rank.</p>

<p class="ind">Where such a property might be must be of course left to
Lord Dalhousie to decide, but the Queen hopes that Lord
Dalhousie will give it his serious attention.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE AUSTRIAN PROPOSALS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Balmoral</span>, <i>10th October 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letters of the 8th.<a id="footnotetagXXIII54" name="footnotetagXXIII54"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIII54"><sup>54</sup></a>
She cannot consider it wise to reject the Austrian proposals
<i>altogether</i>, although we may usefully amend them. The success
in the Crimea ought to be followed up by strengthening the
alliance of the European powers, else it may turn out a sterile
victory, and the English blood will have flowed in vain; for
supposing even the whole Crimea to fall into our hands, it is not
likely that the war will be concluded on that account. How
are England and France to bring it to a termination single-handed?
Our Army in the Crimea is the only one we have....</p>

<p class="ind">It is true that the Austrian proposal promises little performance
on her part, yet the stipulation by Treaty that she will
never let the Russians pass the Pruth again is a positive advantage
to us; and the other, that a defensive and offensive
alliance with us is to follow the breaking out of the war by
Russia against Austria, although being entirely at <i>our</i> expense,
yet realises the chief condition which will make Austria hesitate
less to bring it to a war with Russia. She always (and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.49" id="pageiii.49"></a>[page&nbsp;49]</span>
without reason) dreaded to have to fight Russia single-handed,
and the allied armies in the Crimea could not assist her.
What reason could Austria put forward and justify to Prussia
and Germany, for going to war at this moment? To obtain
the evacuation of the Principalities was a tangible one, indeed
the same <i>we</i> put forward when <i>we</i> declared war; but this is
now obtained.</p>

<p class="ind">We must certainly not allow our policy to be mixed up with
the miserable German squabbles, but we must acknowledge
that Austria, as a member of the Confederation, is not and
cannot be independent of them.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen would accordingly advise a temperate consideration
of the Austrian proposals and an amendment of them in
those points which seem to require them, and which Lord
Clarendon clearly points out in his letter, and the avoidance
of anything which could weaken the <i>accord Europ&eacute;en</i>.<sup>55</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The Emperor Napoleon's answer to Lord Cowley with reference
to this visit to England renders it probable to the
Queen that he was not anxious to have the general invitation
changed into a special one, <i>obliging</i> him to come or to refuse.
The answer is almost a refusal now, and has not improved our
position. The Queen would wish that no anxiety should be
shown to obtain the visit, now that it is quite clear to the
Emperor that he will be <i>le bienvenu</i> at any time. His reception
here ought to be a boon to him and not a boon to us.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen fully enters into the feelings of exultation and
joy at the glorious victory of the Alma, but this is somewhat
damped by the sad loss we have sustained, and the thought
of the many bereaved families of all classes who are in mourning
for those near and dear to them.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;Already far away from my loved
beautiful Highlands and Mountains, I find a few minutes to
write and thank you for your kind letter of the 2nd, with
such lively and glowing descriptions of such glorious and
beautiful scenery, which I hope and trust to see <i>some day</i>.
Still, with all its beauties, I would not exchange it for our
northern beauties, which really they are&mdash;for a <i>lovelier</i> country
with a <i>more beautiful</i> combination of wood and mountain,
and river, and cultivation with the greatest wildness, at the
same time close at hand, cannot, I am sure, be seen; Stockmar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.50" id="pageiii.50"></a>[page&nbsp;50]</span>
is in the greatest admiration of it. We left it yesterday
morning, slept at Holyrood last night, and came here this
evening; the good people of this large port, having since two
years entreated us to come here. We shall reach Windsor
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="ind">We are, and indeed the whole country is, <i>entirely</i> engrossed
with one idea, one <i>anxious</i> thought&mdash;the <i>Crimea</i>. We have
received all the <i>most</i> interesting and <i>gratifying</i> details of the
<i>splendid</i> and decisive victory of the Alma; alas! it was a
bloody one. Our loss was a heavy one&mdash;many have fallen
and many are wounded, but my noble Troops behaved with
a <i>courage</i> and <i>desperation</i> which was beautiful to behold.
The Russians expected their position would hold out three
weeks; their loss was immense&mdash;the whole garrison of Sebastopol
was out. Since that, the Army has performed a wonderful
march to Balaklava, and the bombardment of Sebastopol
has begun. Lord Raglan's behaviour was worthy of the old
Duke's&mdash;such coolness in the midst of the hottest fire. We
have had all the details from young Burghersh<sup>56</sup> (a remarkably
nice young man), one of Lord Raglan's Aides-de-camp whom
he sent home with the Despatches, who was in the midst of it
all. I feel so <i>proud</i> of my dear noble Troops, who, they say,
bear their privations, and the sad disease which still haunts
them, with such courage and good humour.</p>

<span class="rightnote">FRANCE AND AUSTRIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>5th November 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter referring to
the new Draft of a Treaty with Austria proposed by the French
Government, and has since attentively perused the Treaty itself.<sup>57</sup>
Vague and inconclusive as it is as to <i>co-operation</i> (which
is the main object of our desire), it is a step in advance, and
has the advantage of assuring Austria of our alliance should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.51" id="pageiii.51"></a>[page&nbsp;51]</span>
the war between her and Russia break out. The Queen regrets
to find a Clause omitted which stood in the former French
project (rejected by us about three weeks ago), stipulating that
Austria was to prevent the re-entry of Russia into the Principalities.
Although she would of her own accord have to do
this, a treaty obligation towards the <i>belligerents</i> to that effect
would have made a considerable inroad into her position as
a <i>neutral</i> power, and secured a co-operation in the war&mdash;<i>ad
hoc</i> at least. Austria ought to be told, in the Queen's opinion,
that this project of treaty contains almost nothing; and that
her signing it <i>at once</i> would give a moral pledge of her sincerity
towards the Western Powers, who have to pay with the lives
of their best troops every day that Austria hesitates to do
what in the end she must find it in her own interest to do.</p>

<p class="ind">As to M. Olozaga's proposal,<sup>58</sup> the Queen thinks it ought to
be treated like all the former ones, viz. met with the remark
that we cannot discuss eventualities implying the dethronement
of a Sovereign with whom we are on a footing of amity.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 57: Lord Clarendon wrote that he and Lord John Russell approved of the treaty, but
that Lord Aberdeen thought that Austria would not accept it; while Lord Palmerston
felt confident that Austria, even if her co-operation were not now secured, would at least
not lend her support to the King of Prussia's scheme.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">At this date only partial and misleading accounts had arrived of the battle of Balaklava,
and it was believed that four English (not Turkish) redoubts had been taken; and,
while the disastrous charge of the Light Brigade had been announced, the success of the
heavy cavalry was not yet known. Anxiety began accordingly to be felt at home as to
the adequacy of the allied forces to encounter the Russian army, augmented as it now was
by the troops which had recently evacuated the Principalities. Accordingly fresh efforts
were being made to engage Austria in effectual alliance with the Western Powers.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 58: The document containing this proposal does not seem to have been preserved among
the papers. It was not impossibly a scheme for betrothing King Pedro to the infant
Princess of the Asturias, thereby uniting the two Crowns, and bringing about the
dethronement of Queen Isabella.

way of our sending what ships we can lay hold of to transport
French reinforcements to the Crimea, as the safety of our
Army and the honour of the Country are at stake. The
Queen is ready to give her own yacht for a transport which could
carry 1,000 men. Every account received convinces the
Queen more and more that numbers alone can ensure success
in this instance, and that without them we are running <i>serious</i>
risks.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 59: The Count wrote that France was ready to send 20,000 men to the Crimea, if England

and clothing for the Army are going out in sailing vessels."

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your
Majesty. He regrets, at a moment of such public interest and
importance, to trouble your Majesty with domestic difficulties;
but he thinks it his duty to lay before your Majesty the enclosed
correspondence without delay.<sup>62</sup> Lord Aberdeen has for some

not to see that it may be attended with very serious consequences.
At first Lord Aberdeen was in doubt whether the
proposition was made by Lord J. Russell in concert with Lord
Palmerston; but this appears not to be the case. Much will
therefore depend on the decision of Lord Palmerston. Should
he join with Lord John, matters will probably be pushed to
extremity; but should he decline, Lord Aberdeen does not
think that Lord John will venture to act alone.</p>

<p class="indright"><i>24th November 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thanks Lord Dalhousie for his long and most
interesting and satisfactory letter of the 2nd of October.</p>

<p class="ind">It is peculiarly gratifying to hear of such quiet and prosperity
in her vast Indian dominions, in which the Queen ever takes
the liveliest interest, and at the present moment of intense
anxiety, when England's best and noblest blood is being profusely
shed to resist the encroaching spirit of Russia. The
heroism of our noble Troops in the midst of herculean difficulties
and great privations is unequalled, and will fill Lord Dalhousie's
loyal and patriotic heart with pride and admiration. Though
entirely concurring in his opinion that Russia can undertake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.54" id="pageiii.54"></a>[page&nbsp;54]</span>
no invasion of India, her spirit of encroachment on the north
frontier must be carefully watched and, if possible, put a stop
to, when peace is made.</p>

<p class="ind">The progress of the railroad will make an immense difference
in India, and tend more than anything else to bring about
civilisation, and will in the end facilitate the spread of Christianity,
which hitherto has made but very slow progress.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen was already aware of the idea formerly entertained
by the Maharajah Dhuleep Singh of marrying the young
Princess of Coorg.<sup>63</sup> Agreeing as she does with Lord Dalhousie
in the wisdom of advising the young man to pause before he
makes his choice of a wife, she thinks such a marriage between
these two most interesting young Christians most desirable;
indeed, as Lord Dalhousie himself observes, the difficulty of
any other marriage for either must be great. The young
people have met and were pleased with each other, so that the
Queen hopes that their union will, in the course of time, come
to pass. Her little god-daughter has been here lately, and
though still childish for her age (she is nearly fourteen) is
pretty, lively, intelligent, and going on satisfactorily in her
education.</p>

<p class="ind">Of the young Maharajah, who has now been twice our guest,
we can only speak in terms of praise. He promises to be a
bright example to all Indian Princes, for he is thoroughly good
and amiable, and most anxious to improve himself.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 63: A few years earlier, while still holding his ancestral creed, Dhuleep Singh, had made
overtures to the ex-Rajah of Coorg with a view to his betrothal to the eldest daughter of
the latter; but at that time the matter was dropped. After becoming a Christian, and
having also heard of the baptism of the Princess of Coorg, the Maharajah renewed his
proposal, which, however, was not eventually accepted. The Princess married an
English officer, and died in 1864, aged twenty-four.

stating the number of dead in the Grenadiers; it was much
larger than I stated. I think we must have suffered more than
any other Corps, for, on the following day, when the roll was
called, two hundred and twenty-five men were absent; of
these one hundred and one were killed, and the rest wounded.
There cannot be any doubt that we allowed ourselves to be
surprised, for the first notice we had of the Russians was
receiving their heavy shot in the camp of the 2nd Division.
Nearly all their tents were torn by round shot. It is even said
that a shell lodged in an officer's portmanteau, burst, and, of
course, scattered all his goods to the winds. Experience has
made us wise, or rather Lord Raglan wise, for since that day
the French and ourselves have been busy in entrenching our
right; it is now so strong that no enemy can attack us there
with the slightest chance of success; it is only a pity it was not
done before. The Turks were chiefly employed making these
redoubts, which is in fact the only thing they have done except
burying the dead Russians. Never shall I forget the sight of
the dead and dying Russians on the field. Some of these poor
wretches had to lie on the field for at least sixty hours before
they were removed to the hospital tents; the majority of
course died. I am afraid this is one of the necessities of war,
for we had to remove our own people first. I went round the
hospitals next morning. It was a horrid sight to see the bodies
of the men who had died during the night stretched before the
tents, and to see the heaps of arms and legs, with the trousers
and boots still on, that had been cut off by the surgeons.</p>

<p class="ind">The Russians were so near that most of the officers had to use
their swords and revolvers. Many single acts of daring took
place; among others, Colonel Percy,<sup>66</sup> of our Regiment, dashed
in front of his Company, sword in hand, into a dense body of
Russians who were in a battery. I was not in the thick of it,
but was engaged with an outlying picquet on the left of the
attack. George was in the very thick of it, and, not seeing me,
kept asking some of our men where I was. They did not know.
He tells me that he thought for a long time I was killed, and
even fancied that he had seen me lying on the ground; it
turned out later to have been poor Colonel Dawson's<sup>67</sup> body
which he mistook for me.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.56" id="pageiii.56"></a>[page&nbsp;56]</span>

<p class="ind">On the 14th we had a terrible storm, such a one as, fortunately
for mankind, does not happen but very rarely. All our tents
of course were blown down, and we passed the day very uncomfortably;
but at sea it was terrible. At Balaklava alone
more than two hundred and sixty souls perished, and eleven
ships went down. George will have been able to give you a
perfect account of it, for, for many hours, the <i>Retribution</i> was
in imminent danger. I went a few days after the storm to see
him on board.<sup>68</sup> ... He had a little fever or ague on him, but was
otherwise well. He has now gone to Constantinople....</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>7th December 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He would have been desirous of personally submitting to your
Majesty the result of the meeting of the Cabinet last night;
but he was apprehensive that his sudden journey to Windsor
Castle this morning would give rise to speculations and conjectures
which, in the present state of the Ministry, it is as well
to avoid.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen thinks he may venture to assure your Majesty
that the correspondence recently circulated is regarded by all
the Members of the Cabinet precisely in the same light; and
that the propositions of Lord John Russell are considered by
all as quite untenable. Lord Palmerston forms no exception;
and, whatever may be his views in future, it is clear that at
present he contemplates no changes in the Government. Lord
John was himself fully aware of this unanimity, and remained
entirely silent with respect to his former suggestions. He
dwelt in general terms on the absence of vigour in the prosecution
of the war, and stated his conviction that the same
course would be observed in future. He referred to his position
in the House of Commons with much bitterness, and declared
that he would never pass such another Session of Parliament
as the last. He attributed the frequent defeats of the Government
in the House of Commons to the Reform Bill having been
withdrawn, by which it was shown that hostile attacks might
be made with impunity.</p>

<p class="ind">It was obvious, however, that the drift of his observations
tended to the substitution of himself as the Head of the Government
rather than to any change of Departments; and this he
did not deny, when Lord Aberdeen pointed out the inference
to be drawn from his remarks.</p>

<p class="ind">Finally, Lord John said that he had quite made up his mind.
He was ready to continue in office during the short Session
before Christmas, and to defend all that had been done; but
that he was determined to retire after Christmas. An observation
being made that it would be unconstitutional to go into
Parliament with such a determination, he replied that, if such
was the opinion, he would request Lord Aberdeen to convey
his resignation to-morrow morning to your Majesty, which, at
all events, would be perfectly constitutional.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.58" id="pageiii.58"></a>[page&nbsp;58]</span>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen feels it to be his duty to state to your Majesty
that, whatever may be the real cause, Lord John has made
up his mind to act in the manner he has announced.</p>

<p class="ind">In this situation it is Lord Aberdeen's desire to come to your
Majesty's assistance by any means in his power. Lord John's
defection will be a great blow, from which it is very doubtful
if the Government could recover; but Lord Aberdeen will come
to no conclusion or form any decided opinion until he shall
have had the honour of seeing your Majesty.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by the Prince Albert.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">CABINET DISSENSIONS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>9th December 1854.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen arrived yesterday evening, leaving the
Cabinet sitting, revising the Speech from the Throne.<sup>70</sup> He
had come to no decision. Sir James Graham and Mr Gladstone
had been anxious that he should accept Lord John's
resignation at once. He himself felt reluctant to do anything
which might be considered harsh towards Lord John, and might
make him a martyr hereafter. There was no doubt, however,
that they could not go on with Lord John. The universal
feeling of the Cabinet seemed to be one of indignation ... at
Lord John's conduct. Nobody had expressed himself stronger
about it than Lord Lansdowne to Lord Clarendon, feeling it, as
he said, "quite a necessity to speak out." The Chancellor
said he owed his political allegiance to Lord John as well as his
office; but as a man of honour he could not go with him. Lord
Granville feels the same. Lord Palmerston had written a long
and very able letter to Lord John, proving the impossibility
of joining the offices of Secretary at War and Secretary of State
for War. Lord John had now, however, dropped his proposal
altogether, and made it quite clear that it was Lord Aberdeen
he wished to have removed. He said to Lord Palmerston:
"When the Cabinet was formed, I always understood that Lord
Aberdeen would soon give me up my old place; it has now
lasted more than two years, and he seemed to get enamoured
with office, and I could not meet the House of Commons in the
position I was in last Session."</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 70: Parliament was to meet on the 12th, chiefly for the purpose of passing a Foreign
Enlistment Bill, authorising the immediate enlistment of 15,000 (afterwards reduced to
10,000) foreigners, to be drilled in this country.
</p>

<p class="ind">In answer to Lord Palmerston's enquiry what he would do,
and how he could expose the Country to such fearful risks at
such a moment, he said that he would support the Government
out of office. "You will support it at the head of a very
virulent Opposition," was Lord Palmerston's reply; "and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.59" id="pageiii.59"></a>[page&nbsp;59]</span>
when you have succeeded in overthrowing the Government,
which has difficulty enough to hold its ground even with your
assistance, what will you say to the Country? Will you
say: 'Here I am. I have triumphed, and have displaced,
in the midst of most hazardous operations, all the ablest men
the Country has produced; but I shall take their place with
Mr Vernon Smith, Lord Seymour, Lord Minto, and others....'"</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Charles Wood is the only person who says it is all nothing,
and he knows Lord John, and it is sure to blow over.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen said it is come to a point where this is no
longer possible, as he laid his ground not only on the position
that the war had been badly conducted, but that it <i>would</i> be
so for the future.</p>

<p class="ind">At the Cabinet yesterday a significant incident occurred:
Lord John asked what should become of Reform. Lord
Aberdeen's answer was, that it had been set aside on account
of the war, and that as the war was now raging at its height,
it could not be brought on again. Later, when they came to
the passage about Education, Lord John made an alteration
in the Draft, adding something about strengthening the institutions
of the Country. Lord Palmerston started up and
asked: "Does that mean Reform?" Lord John answered:
"It might or might not." "Well, then," said Lord Palmerston,
with a heat of manner which struck the whole Cabinet,
and was hardly justified by the occasion, "I wish it to be
understood that I protest against any direct or indirect attempt
to bring forward the Reform question again!" Lord
John, nettled, muttered to himself, but loud enough to be
heard by everybody: "Then I shall bring forward the
Reform Bill at once."</p>

<p class="ind">It is evident to me that after this a junction between Lord
Palmerston and Lord John is impossible, and that it must have
been Lord Palmerston's object to make this clear to the Cabinet.
Lord Aberdeen has declared that he is quite willing to yield
his post to Lord John&mdash;but that it would not suffice to have
got a head&mdash;that there must be some Members also, and where
are they to be found? He is certain that not one of the
present Cabinet could now serve under Lord John. An
attempt to solve the question how the present Government
is to be maintained, naturally leads everybody to the same
conclusion: that Lord Palmerston must be substituted for
Lord John as the Leader of the House of Commons. Disagreeable
as this must be ... to Lord Aberdeen, and dangerous
as the experiment may turn out, we agreed with Lord Aberdeen
that he should make the offer to him with the Queen's consent.
An alternative proposed by Lord Clarendon, that Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.60" id="pageiii.60"></a>[page&nbsp;60]</span>
Aberdeen should ask Lord John what he advised him to do
under the circumstances, was strongly condemned by me, as
depriving Lord Aberdeen of all the advantage of the initiative
with Lord Palmerston. Lord Aberdeen states his great
difficulty to be not only the long antecedent and mutual
opposition between him and Lord Palmerston, but also the
fact that Lord Palmerston loved war for war's sake, and he
peace for peace' sake.... He consoled himself, however, at
last by the reflection that Lord Palmerston was not worse than
Lord John in that respect, and, on the other hand, gave greater
weight to the consideration of what was practicable. It remains
open for the present whether Lord John is to act as the
organ for the Government during the short Session, and resign
afterwards, or to resign now.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
The Cabinet met to-day, and discussed various measures,
with a view to their introduction into Parliament during the
course of the ensuing Session. In this discussion Lord John
Russell took an active part, and must have greatly astonished
his colleagues, after their knowledge of all that had recently
passed. Lord Aberdeen had been previously made aware,
although not by himself, of the change which had taken place in
Lord John's intentions. After the meeting of the Cabinet,
Lord John came to Lord Aberdeen, and spoke of the affair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.61" id="pageiii.61"></a>[page&nbsp;61]</span>
Mr Kennedy,<sup>72</sup> but did not seem disposed to advert to any other
subject. Lord Aberdeen therefore took an opportunity of
referring to the correspondence which had taken place, and the
notice which had been given by Lord John. Without any
embarrassment, or apparent sense of inconsistency, he at once
admitted that he had changed his intention, and attributed
it chiefly to a conversation yesterday with Lord Panmure,
who, although a great military reformer, had convinced him
that the present was not a fitting time for his proposed changes.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen had not seen any member of the Cabinet
this evening since the meeting terminated, and does not know
how they may be affected by this change. Some, he feels sure,
will be disappointed; but, on the whole, he feels disposed to
be well satisfied. It is true that there can be no security for
a single week; and it is impossible to escape from a sense
of self-degradation by submitting to such an unprecedented
state of relations amongst colleagues; but the scandal of a
rupture would be so great, and the evils which might ensue so
incalculable, that Lord Aberdeen is sincerely convinced it will
be most advantageous for your Majesty's service, and for the
public, to endeavour, by a conciliatory and prudent course of
conduct, to preserve tranquillity and union as long as possible.
This does not exclude the necessity of firmness; and in the
present case Lord Aberdeen has yielded nothing whatever,
but he has received Lord John's change without resentment or
displeasure.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXIV</h3>


<p>At the end of the year 1854, negotiations had been on foot with a
view to terminating the war, on terms which were known as the
"Four Points," the third of which was designed to extinguish
Russian preponderance in the Black Sea; and a conference of the
Powers ultimately assembled at Vienna for the purpose. Early in
1855, Sardinia, under the influence of Cavour, her Premier, joined
the Western Alliance against Russia. On Parliament re-assembling
in January, Mr Roebuck gave notice of a motion for the appointment
of a Committee to enquire into the conduct of the war. Lord John
Russell, finding himself unable to resist the motion, at once resigned,
and the Ministry was overwhelmingly defeated by a majority of more
than two to one. Lord Derby, as Leader of the Conservative
Opposition, was summoned to form a Ministry, but failed to do so;
the age of Lord Lansdowne prevented his accepting the Premiership;
and Lord John Russell, whose action had largely contributed to the
defeat of the coalition, then attempted the task, but found that he
could not command the support even of his old Whig colleagues. The
Queen accordingly desired Lord Palmerston, whom the voice of the
country unmistakably indicated for the Premiership, to construct a
Government; he was successful in the attempt, the Cabinet being a
reconstruction of that of Lord Aberdeen, with Lord Panmure substituted
for the Duke of Newcastle at the War Office, while Lord
John Russell was appointed British Plenipotentiary at the Vienna
Conference. The new Premier desired to prevent the actual appointment
of the Committee which Mr Roebuck's motion demanded, the
displacement of the late Ministry&mdash;the real objective of the attack&mdash;having
been effected; but as the House of Commons manifested a
determination to proceed with the appointment of the Committee,
the Peelite section of the Cabinet (Sir James Graham, Mr Gladstone,
and Mr Sidney Herbert) withdrew, and Lord John Russell, who was
then on his way to Vienna, accepted the Secretaryship of the Colonies.
Early in March, the Czar Nicholas died suddenly of pulmonary
apoplexy, and the expectation of peace increased; shortly afterwards,
the Emperor and Empress of the French paid a state visit to this
country, and were received with much enthusiasm, the Emperor
being made a Knight of the Garter.</p>

<p>In February, a determined attack by the Russians upon Eupatoria
was repulsed by the Turks; the defenders of Sebastopol, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.64" id="pageiii.64"></a>[page&nbsp;64]</span>
succeeded in occupying and fortifying an important position, afterwards
known as the "Mamelon." The bombardment was resumed
by the Allies in April, and a successful attack made upon Kertsch,
from which the supplies of Sebastopol were mainly drawn; while
a squadron under Captain Lyons destroyed the Russian magazines
and stores in the Sea of Azov. General Canrobert was succeeded in
the French command by General P&eacute;lissier, and on the 7th of June
the Mamelon was taken by the French. A desperate but, as it
proved, unsuccessful assault was then made by the Allies on the
Redan and Malakhoff batteries; at this juncture Lord Raglan died,
and was succeeded in the command by General Simpson.</p>

<p>The Vienna Conference proved abortive, Russia refusing to accept
the third point, and though a compromise was proposed by Austria,
which was favoured by the British and French Plenipotentiaries,
their respective Governments did not ratify their views. The negotiations
accordingly broke down, and Lord John Russell, on his
return, used language in Parliament quite inconsistent with the view
which it afterwards appeared he had urged at Vienna. He was loudly
denounced for this, and, to avoid Parliamentary censure, again
resigned office.</p>

<p>Among the measures which became law during the session, were
those for enabling companies to be formed with limited liability, and
for granting self-government to some of the Australasian Colonies.
The Committee appointed by the House of Commons held its meetings
in public (after a proposal to keep its investigations secret had
been rejected), and, by the casting vote of the Chairman, reported that
the late Cabinet, when directing the expedition to the Crimea, had
had no adequate information as to the force they would have to
encounter there; but a motion to "visit with severe reprehension"
every member of the Cabinet was parried by carrying the "previous
question."</p>

<p>In August, the Queen and Prince Albert paid a return visit to the
French Emperor, and were received with great magnificence in Paris,
while later in the year King Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia visited this
country, and was made a Knight of the Garter. On the 9th of
August, Sweaborg was severely bombarded by the allied fleets in the
Baltic, and a forlorn attempt to raise the siege of Sebastopol resulted
in another decisive success at the Tchernaya, the Sardinian contingent
fighting with great bravery. Sebastopol fell on the 8th of
September, after a siege of three hundred and forty-nine days; the
citadel of Kinburn was bombarded and surrendered in October, after
which General Simpson retired, in favour of Sir William Codrington.
On the other hand, the fortress of Kars in Armenia, which had been
defended by General Fenwick Williams, had to surrender to the
Russian General Mouravieff, in circumstances, however, so honourable,
that the officers were allowed to retain their swords, and their
General received a Baronetcy and a pension of &pound;1000 a year.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen received Lord Clarendon's box by special messenger
yesterday evening. The acceptance by Russia of our
interpretation of the four points<sup>1</sup> is a most clever, diplomatic
man&oelig;uvre, and very embarrassing for us at this moment,
before Sebastopol is taken, and before Austria has been compelled
to join in the war. It leaves us no alternative but to
meet in conference, which, however, in the Queen's opinion,
ought to be preceded by a despatch to Austria, putting on
record our opinion as to the nature and object of the step taken
by Russia, and the advantages she hopes to derive by it from
Austria and Germany, and the disadvantages she expects to
inflict on the Western Powers. As hostilities ought not to
be interrupted unless the Russians give up Sebastopol and
evacuate the Crimea (which would give rest and quiet to our
poor soldiers), there still remains the hope of our getting the
place before preliminaries of peace could be signed; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.66" id="pageiii.66"></a>[page&nbsp;66]</span>
that case a Peace on the four points would be everything we
could desire, and much preferable to the chance of future
convulsions of the whole state of Europe. Russia would then
have yielded all our wishes for the future.</p>

<p class="ind">A mere moral defeat, such as Count Buol seems disposed
to consider as sufficient, would soon prove to have been none
at all, and Austria would be the Power which, to its cost,
would find out (when too late) that the preponderance of
Russia is by no means diminished.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has given her permission to Lord John to go to
Paris; he will find the Emperor as little able to help himself
in this stage of the business as ourselves.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is afraid that the news of the Russian acceptance
may induce our commanders in the Crimea to rest on their
oars, and thinks it necessary, therefore, that immediate orders
should go out, pointing out that the early fall of the town is
just now more important than ever.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes Lord Clarendon to communicate this
letter to Lord Aberdeen and the Duke of Newcastle.</p>

<p class="ind">She returns to Windsor this afternoon.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">Towards the end of 1854, negotiations as to the Four Points had been proceeding
between the Allies and Austria, and on the 28th of December the Three Powers had
agreed in communicating to Russia a memorandum giving a more exact interpretation
of the Four Points. This was agreed upon as the basis on which the Plenipotentiaries
were to meet at Vienna to settle the Eastern Question, and to conclude the war.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">Another event, productive ultimately of results of great importance, took place at
the end of January. King Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia joined the Western Alliance,
and despatched 15,000 men under General La Marmora to the Crimea. This act was
inspired by Cavour, the Sardinian Prime Minister, who took the step that Austria hesitated
to take, and thereby established strong claims both upon the Emperor Napoleon and
Lord Palmerston.

the Queen wishes to give a public testimony of her continued
confidence in Lord Aberdeen's administration, by offering him
the vacant Blue Ribbon. The Queen need not add a word
on her personal feelings of regard and friendship for Lord
Aberdeen, which are known to him now for a long period of
years.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your
Majesty. He has had the honour of receiving your Majesty's
most gracious letter, and humbly begs to return your Majesty
his grateful acknowledgments for this mark of your Majesty's
continued confidence and favour. When your Majesty
mentioned the subject to Lord Aberdeen some time ago, he
had not thought of any such distinction; and perhaps at his
time of life, and with his present prospects, he scarcely ought
to do so. There is no doubt that this unequivocal mark of
gracious favour might strengthen his hands, and especially in
those quarters where it would be most useful; but the power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.67" id="pageiii.67"></a>[page&nbsp;67]</span>
of misconstruction and malevolence is so great that the effect
might possibly be more injurious than beneficial.</p>

<p class="ind">Perhaps your Majesty would be graciously pleased to permit
Lord Aberdeen to reflect a little on the subject, and to submit
his thoughts to your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen entreats your Majesty to believe that in this,
as in everything else, it is his desire to look exclusively to your
Majesty's welfare. When he leaves your Majesty's service,
your Majesty may be fully aware of his many imperfections as
a Minister; but he trusts that your Majesty will always have
reason to regard him as perfectly disinterested.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>11th January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your
Majesty. He has maturely reflected on the subject of your
Majesty's gracious letter of yesterday, and he is fully sensible
of the very important advantage which, in his official position,
he might derive from such a public and signal proof of your
Majesty's confidence and favour.</p>

<p class="ind">Although this might naturally give rise to more or less of
political animadversion, Lord Aberdeen would not hesitate in
his decision, if the alternative were only between himself and
some Peer of high rank whose claim consisted in being a supporter
of the Government; but Lord Aberdeen believes that
he may venture to make a suggestion to your Majesty, the
effect of which would redound to your Majesty's honour, and
which might not prove altogether disadvantageous to himself.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen understands that in consequence of the
regulations of the Order, Lord Cardigan could not properly
receive the Grand Cross of the Bath. From his rank and station,
Lord Cardigan might fairly pretend to the Garter, but his
violent party politics would make it impossible for Lord Aberdeen,
under ordinary circumstances, to submit his name to
your Majesty for this purpose. At the same time, Lord Cardigan's
great gallantry and personal sacrifices seem to afford him
a just claim to your Majesty's favourable consideration; and
Lord Aberdeen believes that to confer upon him the Blue Ribbon
at this moment would be regarded as a very graceful act
on the part of your Majesty. It is even possible that Lord
Aberdeen's political opponents might give him some credit for
tendering such advice.</p>

<p class="ind">If therefore your Majesty should be pleased to take the same
view of this matter, Lord Aberdeen would communicate with
Lord Cardigan on his arrival in London, and would willingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.68" id="pageiii.68"></a>[page&nbsp;68]</span>
postpone all consideration of your Majesty's gracious intentions
towards himself. But Lord Aberdeen will venture humbly to
repeat his grateful sense of all your Majesty's kindness, and his
acknowledgments for the expression of sentiments which he can
never sufficiently value.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>12th January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the enclosed despatch to the Duke of
Newcastle, which she has read with much pleasure, as bringing
before Lord Raglan in an official manner&mdash;which will require
official enquiry and <i>answer</i>&mdash;the various points so urgently
requiring his attention and remedial effort. It is at the same
time so delicately worded that it ought not to offend, although
it cannot help, from its matter, being painful to Lord Raglan.
The Queen has only one remark to make, viz. the entire omission
of her name throughout the document. It speaks simply
in the name of the <i>People</i> of England, and of <i>their</i> sympathy,
whilst the Queen feels it to be one of her highest prerogatives
and dearest duties to care for the welfare and success of <i>her</i>
Army. Had the despatch not gone before it was submitted to
the Queen, in a few words the Duke of Newcastle would have
rectified this omission.</p>

<p class="ind">The Duke of Newcastle might with truth have added that,
making every allowance for the difficulties before Sebastopol,
it is difficult to imagine how the Army could ever be <i>moved</i> in the
field, if the impossibility of keeping it alive is felt in a <i>stationary
camp</i> only seven miles from its harbour, with the whole British
Navy and hundreds of transports at its command.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of the 11th,
and has since seen Lord John Russell's letter. It shows that
the practice of the Queen's different Cabinet Ministers going to
Paris, to have personal explanations with the Emperor, besides
being hardly a constitutional practice, must lead to much
misunderstanding. How is the Emperor to distinguish between
the views of the Queen's Government and the private opinions
of the different members of the Cabinet, all more or less varying,
particularly in a Coalition Government?</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes therefore that this will be the last such

<span class="rightnote">LETTER FROM LORD RAGLAN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Before Sebastopol</span>, <i>20th January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Raglan presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and
has the honour to acknowledge with every sentiment of devotion
and gratitude your Majesty's most gracious letter of 1st
January, and the kind wishes which your Majesty and the
Prince are pleased to unite in offering to the Army and your
Majesty's most humble servant on the occasion of the New
Year.</p>

<p class="ind">The deep concern and anxiety felt by your Majesty and the
Prince for the privations of the troops, their unceasing labours,
their exposure to bad weather, and the extensive sickness
which prevails among them, are invaluable proofs of the lively
interest which your Majesty and His Royal Highness take in
the welfare of an Army which, under no circumstances, will
cease to revere the name, and apply all its best energies to the
service of your Majesty.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE COMMISSARIAT</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Raglan can with truth assure your Majesty that his
whole time and all his thoughts are occupied in endeavouring
to provide for the various wants of your Majesty's troops. It
has not been in his power to lighten the burthen of their duties.
Those exacted from them before Sebastopol are for the preservation
of the trenches and batteries; and there are many other
calls upon the men, more especially when, as at present, the
roads are so bad that wheeled carriages can no longer be used,
and that the horse transport is diminished by sickness and
death, and that the Commissariat, having no longer any sufficient
means of conveyance at its command, cannot bring up
the daily supplies without their assistance, thereby adding,
however inevitably, to their labour and fatigue.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Raglan begs leave to submit, for your Majesty's information,
that the Allied Armies have no intercourse with the
country, and can derive no resources from it; and consequently
all the requirements for the conveyance of stores and provisions,
as well as the stores and provisions themselves, must be imported.
Such a necessity forms in itself a difficulty of vast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.70" id="pageiii.70"></a>[page&nbsp;70]</span>
magnitude, which has been greatly felt by him, and has been
productive of the most serious consequences to the comfort and
welfare of the Army.</p>

<p class="ind">The coffee sent from Constantinople has been received and
issued to the troops green, the Commissariat having no means
whatever of roasting it. Very recently, however, an able
officer of the Navy, Captain Heath of the <i>Sanspareil</i>, undertook
to have machines made by the engineers on board his ship for
roasting coffee; and in this he has succeeded, but they have not
yet produced as much as is required for the daily consumption.</p>

<p class="ind">The Commissary-General applied to the Treasury for roasted
coffee three months ago. None has as yet arrived. A very
large amount of warm clothing has been distributed, and your
Majesty's soldiers, habited in the cloaks of various countries,
might be taken for the troops of any nation as well as those of
England.</p>

<p class="ind">Huts have arrived in great abundance, and as much progress
is made in getting them up as could be hoped for, considering
that there has been a very heavy fall of snow, and that a thaw
has followed it, and the extremely limited means of conveyance
at command.</p>

<p class="ind">Much having been said, as Lord Raglan has been given to
understand, in private letters, of the inefficiency of the officers
of the Staff, he considers it to be due to your Majesty, and a
simple act of justice to those individuals, to assure your Majesty
that he has every reason to be satisfied with their exertions,
their indefatigable zeal, and undeviating, close attention
to their duties, and he may be permitted to add that the horse
and mule transport for the carriage of provisions and stores are
under the charge of the Commissariat, not of the Staff, and
that the Department in question engages the men who are hired
to take care of it, and has exclusive authority over them.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Raglan transmitted to the Duke of Newcastle, in the
month of December, the report of a Medical Board, which he
caused to assemble at Constantinople for the purpose of ascertaining
the state of health of the Duke of Cambridge. The
report evidently showed the necessity of His Royal Highness's
return to England for its re-establishment. This, Lord Raglan
knows, was the opinion of the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel
Macdonald,<sup>4</sup> whose attention and devotion to His Royal Highness
could not be surpassed, and who was himself very anxious
to remain with the Army.</p>

<p class="ind">The Duke, however, has not gone further than Malta, where,
it is said, his health has not improved.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of yesterday,
giving an account of the proceedings of the last Cabinet....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is quite prepared to sanction the proposal of
constituting the Secretary of State for War, the Commander-in-Chief,
the Master-General of the Ordnance, and the Secretary
at War, a Board on the affairs of the Army, which promises
more unity of action in these Departments, and takes notice of
the fact that the powers and functions of the Commander-in-Chief
are not to be changed. As these, however, rest entirely
on tradition, and are in most cases ambiguous and undefined,
the Queen would wish that they should be clearly defined, and
this the more so as she transacts certain business directly with
him, and ought to be secured against getting into any collision
with the Secretary of State, who also takes her pleasure, and
gives orders to the Commander-in-Chief. She would further
ask to be regularly furnished with the Minutes of the proceedings
of the new Board, in order to remain acquainted with what is
going on.</p>

<p class="ind">Unless, however, the Militia be made over to the direction
of the Secretary of State for <i>War</i>, our Army system will still
remain very incomplete. The last experience has shown that
the Militia will have to be looked upon as the chief source for
recruiting the Army, and this will never be done harmoniously
and well, unless they both be brought under the same control.</p>

<p class="ind">With reference to the Investiture of the Garter, the Queen
need not assure Lord Aberdeen that there are few, if any, on
whom she will confer the Blue Ribbon with greater pleasure
than on so kind and valued a friend as he is to us both.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by the Prince Albert.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>25th January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Yesterday evening Lord Aberdeen came down here. He had
heard that Lord John had written to the Queen, and she showed
him the correspondence. He then reported that Lord John's
letter to him had come without the slightest notice and warning,
and whatever the cause for it might be, the object could only be
to upset the Government. Upon receiving it, he had sent for
the Duke of Newcastle and shown it to him. The Duke at
once proposed, that as a sacrifice seemed to be required to
appease the public for the want of success in the Crimea, he
was quite ready to be that sacrifice, and entreated that Lord
Aberdeen would put his office into the hands of Lord Palmerston,
who possessed the confidence of the nation; Lord
Aberdeen should propose this at once to the Cabinet, he himself
would support the Government <i>out</i> of office like <i>in</i> office. Lord
Aberdeen then went to Lord Palmerston to communicate to him
what had happened, and ascertain his feelings. Lord Palmerston
was disgusted at Lord John's behaviour,<sup>5</sup> and did not
consider himself the least bound to be guided by him; he
admitted that somehow or other the Public had a notion that
he would manage the War Department better than anybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.73" id="pageiii.73"></a>[page&nbsp;73]</span>
else; as for himself, he did not expect to do it half so well as
the Duke of Newcastle, but was prepared to try it, not to let the
Government be dissolved, which at this moment would be a
real calamity for the country.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 5: Lord Palmerston wrote him a most scathing letter on the subject.
</p>

<p class="ind">The Cabinet met at two o'clock, and Lord Aberdeen laid the
case before it. The Duke then made his proposal, and was
followed by Lord Palmerston, who stated pretty much the
same as he had done in the morning, upon which Sir George
Grey said it did both the Duke and Lord Palmerston the highest
honour, but he saw no possibility of resisting Mr Roebuck's
Motion without Lord John; Sir Charles Wood was of the same
opinion. Lord Clarendon proposed that, as the Duke had given
up his Department to Lord Palmerston, Lord John might be
induced to remain; but this was at once rejected by Lord
Aberdeen on the ground that they might be justified in sacrificing
the Duke to the wishes of the Country, but they could not
to Lord John, with any degree of honour. The upshot was,
that the Whig Members of the Cabinet, not being inclined to
carry on the Government (including Lord Lansdowne), they
came to the unanimous determination to tender their resignations.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen protested against this, as exposing her and the
Country to the greatest peril, as it was impossible to change the
Government at this moment without deranging the whole
external policy in diplomacy and war, and there was nobody
to whom the reins could be confided. Lord Derby and his
party would never have done, but now he had allied himself
with Lord Ellenborough, who was determined to have the
conduct of the war....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen thought yet, that on him<sup>6</sup> devolved the
responsibility of replacing what he wantonly destroyed. The
Queen insisted, however, that Lord Aberdeen should make
one appeal to the Cabinet to stand by her, which he promised
to do to the best of his ability, but without hope of success.
The Cabinet will meet at twelve o'clock to-day, but at five the
Ministers will have to announce their determination to the
Houses of Parliament, as Mr Roebuck's Motion stands for that
hour.</p>

justice to the high-minded and disinterested manner in which
Lord John sacrificed two years ago his position as former
Prime Minister and as Leader of a great party, in consenting
to serve under Lord Aberdeen, and hopes she has sufficiently
expressed this to him at the time. He will since have found
a further proof of her desire to do anything which could be
agreeable to him in his position, by cheerfully agreeing to all
the various changes of offices which he has at different times
wished for. If Lord John will consider, however, the moment
which he has now chosen to leave her Government, and the
abrupt way in which his unexpected intention of agreeing in
a vote implying censure of the Government was announced
to her, he cannot be surprised that she could not express her
approbation.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen arrived at six o'clock to report the result
of the meeting of the Cabinet, which was so far satisfactory that
they agreed upon retaining office at present for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.75" id="pageiii.75"></a>[page&nbsp;75]</span>
of meeting Mr Roebuck's Motion. They expect (most of
them, at least) to be beat and to have to resign, but they think
it more honourable to be driven out than to run away. They
will meet Parliament therefore without making any changes
in the offices. Lord Aberdeen and the Duke of Newcastle
fancy even that they will have a chance of defeating Mr Roebuck's
Motion. Sir George Grey has declared, however, that,
perfectly willing as he is not to desert his post at this moment,
he will consider himself at liberty to resign even after success,
as he thinks the Government has no chance of standing with
Lord John in Opposition. The other Whigs would in that case
very likely do the same, and the Government come to an end
in this way; but it is not impossible that Sir George Grey may
be prevailed upon by the Queen to stay. Much must depend
upon the nature of the Debate.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen seems to have put the Queen's desire that
the Cabinet should reconsider their former decision in the
strongest words, which seems to have brought about the
present result. He saw Lord John this morning who, though
personally civil towards himself, was very much excited and
very angry at a letter which he had received from the Queen.
He said he would certainly vote with Mr Roebuck. The Houses
are to be adjourned to-day, and the whole discussion comes on
to-morrow. Lord Aberdeen brought a copy of a letter Lord
Palmerston had written to Lord John. The Peelites in the
Cabinet, viz. the Dukes of Newcastle and Argyll, Sir J. Graham,
Mr Gladstone, and Mr S. Herbert, seem to be very bitter against
Lord John, and determined to oppose him should he form a
Government, whilst they would be willing to support a Derby
Government.</p>

<span class="rightnote">MR ROEBUCK'S MOTION</span>

<p class="indright">144 <span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>26th January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that Lord John Russell having
made his statement, concluding with an announcement that
he did not mean to vote on Mr Roebuck's Motion, and Viscount
Palmerston having made a few remarks on that statement,
Mr Roebuck rose to make his Motion; but the paralytic affection
under which he has for some time laboured soon overpowered
him, and before he had proceeded far in his speech
he became so unwell that he was obliged to finish abruptly,
make his Motion, and sit down.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Sidney Herbert, who was to reply to Mr Roebuck, rose
therefore under great disadvantage, as he had to reply to a
speech which had not been made; but he acquitted himself
with great ability, and made an excellent statement in explanation
and defence of the conduct of the Government.
He was followed by Mr Henry Drummond,<sup>8</sup> Colonel North for
the Motion, Mr Monckton Milnes against it; Lord Granby who,
in supporting the Motion, praised and defended the Emperor
of Russia; Mr Layard, who in a speech of much animation, gave
very strong reasons to show the great impropriety of the
Motion, and ended by saying he should vote for it; Sir George
Grey, who made a spirited and excellent speech; Mr Walpole,
who supported the Motion and endeavoured, but fruitlessly,
to establish a similarity between the enquiry proposed by
Mr Roebuck and the enquiry in a Committee of the whole
House into the conduct of the Walcheren Expedition when
the operation was over and the Army had returned to England.
Mr Vernon Smith declared that his confidence in the Government
had been confined to three Members&mdash;Lord Lansdowne,
Lord John Russell, and Lord Palmerston&mdash;and that it was
greatly diminished by the retirement of Lord John Russell.
Colonel Sibthorp,<sup>9</sup> Sir John Fitzgerald, and Mr Knightley<sup>10</sup>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.77" id="pageiii.77"></a>[page&nbsp;77]</span>
followed, and Mr Disraeli having said that his side of the

adjournment to Monday was agreed to; but Viscount Palmerston,
in consenting to the adjournment, expressed a strong hope
that the Debate would not be protracted beyond that night.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE DEBATE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>27th January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
It is probable that your Majesty may have heard from Lord
Palmerston some account of the debate in the House of
Commons last night; but perhaps your Majesty may not
object to learn the impressions which Lord Aberdeen has
received on the present state of affairs both in and out of the
House.</p>

<p class="ind">There can be no doubt that Lord John Russell has injured
his position by the course which he has pursued. His own
friends having remained in the Cabinet, is his practical condemnation.
He made a very elaborate and dexterous statement;
but which, although very plausible, did not produce
a good effect. It had been decided that he should be followed
by Mr Gladstone, who was in full possession of the subject;
but at the Cabinet yesterday held before the meeting of the
House, it was decided that Lord Palmerston should follow
Lord John, in order to prevent the appearance of a division
in the Cabinet between the Whig and Peelite Members. As
Lord Palmerston was to act as Leader of the House, the substitution
of Mr Gladstone would have appeared strange. But
the decision was unfortunate, for by all accounts the speech of
Lord Palmerston was singularly unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="ind">In the debate which followed, the impression in the House
was strongly against the War Department; and the indications
which occasionally appeared of the possibility of Lord Palmerston
filling that office were received with great cordiality. Sir
George Grey made an excellent speech, and his censure must
have been deeply felt by Lord John.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen has waited until the Cabinet had met to-day
before he had the honour of writing to your Majesty, in order
that he might learn the impressions and opinions of the
Members, especially of those who are in the House of Commons.
All agree that if the division had taken place last night, Mr
Roebuck's Motion would have been carried by a large majority.
This still seems to be the prevailing opinion, but there is considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.78" id="pageiii.78"></a>[page&nbsp;78]</span>
difference. The Motion is so objectionable and so
unconstitutional that delay is likely to be favourable to those
who oppose it. A little reflection must produce considerable
effect. Lord Aberdeen sees that Mr Gladstone is preparing
for a great effort, and he will do whatever can be effected by
reason and eloquence.</p>

<p class="ind">It is said that Lord Derby shows some reluctance to accept
the responsibility of overthrowing the Government; but the
part taken last night by Mr Walpole, and the notice of a Motion
in the House of Lords by Lord Lyndhurst, would appear to
denote a different policy. The result of the Division on
Monday will depend on the course adopted by his friends,
<i>as a party</i>. It is said that Mr Disraeli has signified a difference
of opinion from Mr Walpole.</p>

<p class="rindent">(2 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>)</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that Mr Roebuck's Motion has
been carried by 305 to 148, being a majority of 157 against
the Government, a great number of the Liberal party voting
in the majority.</p>

<p class="ind">The debate was begun by Mr Stafford,<a id="footnotetagXXIV11" name="footnotetagXXIV11"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIV11"><sup>11</sup></a> who gave a very
interesting but painful account of the mismanagement which
he had witnessed in the Hospitals at Scutari and Sebastopol,
while he gave due praise to the conduct of His Royal Highness
the Duke of Cambridge toward the men under his command,
and related the cheering effect produced by your Majesty's
kind letter, when read by him to the invalids in Hospital. He
was followed by Mr Bernal Osborne,<a id="footnotetagXXIV12" name="footnotetagXXIV12"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIV12"><sup>12</sup></a> who found fault with all
the military arrangements at home, and with the system under
which Commissions in the Army are bought and sold, but who
declared that he should vote against the Motion.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Henley then supported the Motion, directing his attack
chiefly against the management of the Transport Service.</p>

<p class="ind">Admiral Berkeley,<a id="footnotetagXXIV13" name="footnotetagXXIV13"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIV13"><sup>13</sup></a> in reply, defended the conduct of the
Admiralty. Major Beresford supported the Motion, but
defended Lord Raglan against the attacks of the newspapers.
Mr. Rice, Member for Dover, opposed the Motion. Mr Miles<a id="footnotetagXXIV14" name="footnotetagXXIV14"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIV14"><sup>14</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.79" id="pageiii.79"></a>[page&nbsp;79]</span>
found fault with the Commissariat, and supported the Motion,
saying that the proposed enquiry would apply a remedy to the
evils acknowledged to exist in the Army in the Crimea; and
Sir Francis Baring, after ably pointing out the inconveniences
of the proposed Committee, said he should vote against it,
as tending to prevent those evils from being remedied. Mr
Rich criticised the composition of the Ministry, and the conduct
of the war, and supported the Motion as a means of satisfying
public opinion. Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer supported the
Motion in a speech of considerable ability, and was replied to
by Mr Gladstone in a masterly speech, which exhausted the
subject, and would have convinced hearers who had not made
up their minds beforehand.</p>

<p class="ind">He was followed by Mr Disraeli, who in the course of his
speech made use of some expressions in regard to Lord John
Russell, which drew from Lord John some short explanations
as to the course which he had pursued. Viscount Palmerston
then made some observations on the Motion, and, after a few
words from Mr Muntz,<sup>15</sup> Mr Thomas Duncombe<sup>16</sup> asked Mr
Roebuck whether, if he carried his Motion, he really meant to
name and appoint the Committee and prosecute the enquiry,
saying that he hoped and trusted that such was Mr Roebuck's
intention. Mr Roebuck declared that he fully meant to do so,
and after a short speech from Mr Roebuck, who lost the thread
of his argument in one part of what he said, the House proceeded
to a division.</p>

<p class="ind">The Conservative Party abstained, by order from their
Chiefs, from giving the cheer of triumph which usually issues
from a majority after a vote upon an important occasion....</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD ABERDEEN RESIGNS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>30th January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen arrived here at three. He came from the
Cabinet, and tendered their unanimous resignation. Nothing
could have been better, he said, than the feeling of the members
towards each other. Had it not been for the incessant attempts
of Lord John Russell to keep up Party differences, it must be
confessed that the experiment of a coalition has succeeded
admirably. We discussed future possibilities, and agreed
that there remained nothing to be done but to offer the Government
to Lord Derby, whose Party was numerically the strongest,
and had carried the Motion. He supposed Lord Derby
would be prepared for it, although he must have great difficulties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.80" id="pageiii.80"></a>[page&nbsp;80]</span>
unless he took in men from other Parties, about which,
however, nothing could be known at present.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen means to behave more generously to Lord
Derby than he had done to him, and felt sure that his colleagues
would feel a desire to support the Queen's new Government.</p>

<p class="ind">He said Lord Grey's plan<sup>17</sup> had not met with the approbation
of the House of Lords. The indignation at Lord John's
conduct on all sides was strongly on the increase.</p>

<span class="rightnote">INTERVIEW WITH LORD DERBY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>31st January 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">We went up to Buckingham Palace and saw Lord Derby at
half-past eleven. The Queen informed him of the resignation
of the Government, and of her desire that he should try to
form a new one. She addressed herself to him as the head of
the largest Party in the House of Commons, and which had by
its vote chiefly contributed to the overthrow of the Government.
Lord Derby threw off this responsibility, saying that
there had been no communication with Mr Roebuck, but that
his followers could not help voting when Lord John Russell
told them on authority that there was the most ample cause
for enquiry, and the whole country cried out for it. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.81" id="pageiii.81"></a>[page&nbsp;81]</span>
the Government, in meeting the Motion, laid its chief stress
upon its implying a want of confidence in the Government&mdash;a
confidence which they certainly did not enjoy. He owned<span class="rightnote">THE LEADERSHIP</span>
that his Party was the most compact&mdash;mustering about two
hundred and eighty men&mdash;but he had no men capable of
governing the House of Commons, and he should not be able
to present an Administration that would be accepted by the
country unless it was strengthened by other combinations; he
knew that the whole country cried out for Lord Palmerston as
the only man fit for carrying on the war with success, and he
owned the necessity of having him in the Government, were it
even only to satisfy the French Government, the confidence
of which was at this moment of the greatest importance; but
he must say, speaking without reserve, that whatever the
ignorant public might think, Lord Palmerston was totally
unfit for the task. He had become very deaf as well as very
blind, was seventy-one years old, and ... in fact, though he
still kept up his sprightly manners of youth, it was evident
that his day had gone by.<sup>19</sup> ... Lord Derby thought, however,
he might have the Lead of the House of Commons, which Mr
Disraeli was ready to give up to him. For the War Department
there were but two men&mdash;both very able, but both
liable to objections: the first was Lord Grey, who would do it
admirably, but with whom he disagreed in general politics, and
in this instance on the propriety of the war, which he himself
was determined to carry on with the utmost vigour; then
came his peculiar views about the Amalgamation of Offices, in
which he did not at all agree. The other was Lord Ellenborough,
who was very able, and would certainly be very popular
with the Army, but was very unmanageable; yet he hoped he
could keep him in order. It might be doubtful whether
Lord Hardinge could go on with him at the Horse Guards.
We agreed in the danger of Lord Grey's Army proposal, and
had to pronounce the opinion that Lord Ellenborough was
almost mad. This led us to a long discussion upon the merits
of the conduct of the war, upon which he seemed to share the
general prejudices, but on being told some of the real facts and
difficulties of the case, owned that these, from obvious reasons,
could not be stated by the Government in their defence, and
said that he was aware that the chief fault lay at headquarters
in the Crimea. Lord Raglan ought to be recalled, as well
as his whole staff, and perhaps he could render this less painful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.82" id="pageiii.82"></a>[page&nbsp;82]</span>
to him by asking him to join the Cabinet, where his military advice
would be of great value.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 19: Lord Derby's judgment was not borne out by subsequent events. Lord Palmerston
was Prime Minister when he died on the 18th of October 1865, ten years later. "The
half-opened cabinet-box on his table, and the unfinished letter on his desk, testified that
he was at his post to the last,"&mdash;Ashley's <i>Life of Lord Palmerston</i>, vol. ii. p. 273.
</p>

<p class="ind">To be able to meet the House of Commons, however, Lord
Derby said he required the assistance of men like Mr
Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert, and he was anxious to know
whether the Queen could tell him upon what support he could
reckon in that quarter. We told him we had reason to believe
the Peelites would oppose a Government of Lord John Russell,
but were inclined to support one of Lord Derby's; whether
they were inclined to join in office, however, appeared very
doubtful. The Queen having laid great stress on a good
selection for the office of Foreign Affairs, Lord Derby said he
would have to return to Lord Malmesbury, who, he thought,
had done well before, and had now additional experience.</p>

<p class="ind">Should he not be able to obtain strength from the Peelites, he
could not be able to form a creditable Government; he must
give up the task, and thought the Queen might try some other
combinations with Lord John Russell or Lord Lansdowne, etc.</p>

<p class="ind">He did not think a reconstruction of the old Government
would be accepted by the country; however, whatever Government
was formed to carry on the war, should not only not be
opposed by him, but have his cordial support, provided it
raised no question of general constitutional importance.</p>

<p class="ind">Should all attempts fail, he would be ready to come forward
to the rescue of the country with such materials as he had, but
it would be "a desperate attempt."</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby returned a little before two from Lord Palmerston,
to whom he had gone in the first instance. Lord Palmerston
was ready to accept the Lead of the House of Commons,
and acknowledged that the man who undertook this could not
manage the War Department besides. He undertook to sound
Mr Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert, but had, evidently much to
Lord Derby's surprise, said that it must be a coalition, and not
only the taking in of one or two persons, which does not seem
to suit Lord Derby at all&mdash;nor was he pleased at Lord Palmerston's
suggestion that he ought to try, by all means, to retain
Lord Clarendon at the Foreign Office. Lord Palmerston was
to sound the Peelites in the afternoon, and Lord Derby is to
report the result to the Queen this evening.</p>

from Viscount Palmerston to the communication which he
made to him this morning by your Majesty's command. Lord
Derby has not yet received from Mr Sidney Herbert and Mr
Gladstone the answers referred to in Lord Palmerston's letter;
but, from the tenor of the latter, he fears there can be no doubt
as to their purport. With respect to Lord Clarendon, Lord
Derby is fully sensible of the advantage which might accrue
to your Majesty's service from the continuance in office of a
Minister of great ability, who is personally cognizant of all
the intricate negotiations and correspondence which have
taken place for the last two years; and neither personally
nor politically would he anticipate on the part of his friends,
certainly not on his own part, any difficulty under existing
circumstances, in co-operating with Lord Clarendon; but the
present political relations between Lord Clarendon and Lord
Derby's friends are such that, except upon a special injunction
from your Majesty, and under your Majesty's immediate
sanction, he would not be justified in making any overtures in
that direction.<sup>20</sup> Should Lord Derby receive any communication
from Mr Gladstone or Mr. Sidney Herbert before morning,
he will send it down to your Majesty by the earliest opportunity
in the morning. Lord Derby trusts that your Majesty
will forgive the haste in which he writes, having actually,
at the moment of receiving Lord Palmerston's answer, written
a letter to say that he could not longer detain your Majesty's
messenger. Lord Derby will take no farther step until he shall

Lord John Russell attempted to include three of the outgoing Ministers in his Cabinet, and
on the formation of the Coalition Ministry, negotiations were on foot to retain Lord
St. Leonards on the woolsack.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD DERBY'S REFUSAL</span>

<p class="indright"><i>1st February 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby came down here at eleven o'clock, and brought
with him two letters he had received from Mr Gladstone and
Mr Sidney Herbert, who both declared their willingness to
give Lord Derby's Government an independent support, but
on mature consideration their impossibility to take office in
his Administration. Lord Derby said, as to the independent
support, it reminded him of the definition of an independent
Member of Parliament, viz. one that could not be depended
upon. Under the circumstances, he would not be able to form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.84" id="pageiii.84"></a>[page&nbsp;84]</span>
such an Administration as could effectively carry on the
Government.</p>

<p class="ind">He thought that Lord Palmerston had at first been willing
to join, but it was now evident that the three letters had been
written in concert.<sup>21</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 21: Lord Palmerston wrote that, upon reflection, he had come to the conclusion that he
would not, by joining the Government, give to it that stability which Lord Derby anticipated.
He, however, gave the promise of his support to any Government which would
carry on the war with energy and vigour, and maintain the alliances which had been
formed.
</p>

<p class="ind">He was anxious to carry any message to any other statesman
with which the Queen might wish to entrust him. This the
Queen declined, with her best thanks. He then wanted to
know what statement Lord Aberdeen would make to-night in
the House, stating it to be very important that it should not
appear that the Administration had gone from Lord Aberdeen
through any other hands than the ones which should finally
accept it.</p>

<p class="ind">It would be well known that he had been <i>consulted</i> by the
Queen, but there was no necessity for making it appear that
he had undertaken to form an Administration. The fact was,
that he had consulted none of his Party except Mr Disraeli,
and that his followers would have reason to complain if they
thought that he had put them altogether out of the question.
We told him that we did not know what Lord Aberdeen meant
to say, but the best thing would be on all accounts to state
exactly the truth as it passed.</p>

<p class="ind">After he had taken leave of the Queen with reiterated
assurances of gratitude and loyalty, I had a further long conversation
with him, pointing out to him facts with which he
could not be familiar, concerning our Army in the Crimea, our
relations with our Ally, negotiations with the German Courts,
the state of public men and the Press in this country, which
convinced me that this country was in a crisis of the greatest
magnitude, and the Crown in the greatest difficulties, which
could not be successfully overcome unless political parties
would show a little more patriotism than hitherto. They
behaved a good deal like his independent Member of Parliament,
and tried to aggravate every little mishap in order to
get Party advantages out of it. I attacked him personally
upon his ... opposition to the Foreign Enlistment Bill, and
pointed to the fact that the French were now obtaining the
services of that very Swiss Legion we stood so much in need of.
His defence was a mere Parliamentary dialectic, accusing the
clumsy way in which Ministers had introduced their Bill, but
he promised to do what he could to relieve the difficulties of
the country. In conclusion I showed him, under injunctions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.85" id="pageiii.85"></a>[page&nbsp;85]</span>
of secrecy, the letter I had received from Count Walewski,
which showed to what a state of degradation the British Crown
had been reduced by the efforts on all sides for Party objects
to exalt the Emperor Napoleon, and make his will and use the
sole standard for the English Government.<sup>22</sup></p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 22: This curious letter of the Count stated in effect that the alliance of England and
France, and the critical circumstances of the day, made Lords Palmerston and Clarendon
indispensable members of any Ministry that might be formed.
</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby called it the most audacious thing he had ever
seen, adding that he had heard that Count Walewski had
stated to somebody with reference to the Vienna Conferences:
"What influence can a country like England pretend to
exercise, which has no Army and no Government?"</p>

<p class="ind">I told him he was right, as every one here took pains to prove
that we had no Army, and to bring about that the Queen
should have no Government.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD LANSDOWNE CONSULTED</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>2nd February 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Lansdowne arrived late yesterday evening. The
Queen, after having stated that Lord Derby had given up the
task of forming a Government, asked his advice under the
present circumstances, to which he replied that he had little
advice to give. I interrupted that at least he could impart
knowledge to the Queen, upon which she could form a decision.
The first and chief question was, What was Lord John<span class="rightnote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL SUGGESTED</span>
Russell's position? Lord Lansdowne declared this to be the
most difficult question of all to answer. He believed Lord
John was not at all dissatisfied with the position he had
assumed, and was under the belief that he could form an
Administration capable of standing, even without the support
of the Peelites. He (Lord Lansdowne) would certainly decline
to have anything to do with it, as it could receive its support
only from the extreme Radical side, which was not favourable
to Lord John, but shrewd enough to perceive that to obtain a
Government that would have to rest entirely upon themselves
would be the surest mode of pushing their own views. Lord
John, although not intending it, would blindly follow this
bias, excusing himself with the consideration that he must look
for support somewhere. He himself doubted, however, even
the possibility of Lord John succeeding; but till he was
brought to see this no strong Government was possible.
We asked about the Peelites, Lord Palmerston, etc. He did
not know whether the Peelites would serve with Lord John
Russell&mdash;they certainly would not under him. There was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.86" id="pageiii.86"></a>[page&nbsp;86]</span>
strong belief, however, particularly on the part of Lord
Clarendon, and even shared by Lord Palmerston, that without
Lord John a stable Government could not be formed. The
Queen asked whether they could unite under him (Lord
Lansdowne). He replied he had neither youth nor strength
to make an efficient Prime Minister, and although Lord John
had often told him "If you had been in Aberdeen's place my
position would have been quite different," he felt sure Lord
John would soon be tired of him and impatient to see him
gone. He thought an arrangement might be possible by which
Lord Clarendon might be Prime Minister, Lord John go to the
House of Lords and take the Foreign Office, and Lord Palmerston
the Lead in the House of Commons. We told him
that would spoil two efficient men. Lord Clarendon had no
courage for Prime Minister, and Lord John had decidedly
failed at the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Lansdowne had had Lord Palmerston with him during
the Derby negotiation, and clearly seen that at first he was not
unwilling to join, but had more and more cooled upon it when
he went further into the matter. Lord Derby and Lord Palmerston
had had a full discussion upon Lord Grey, and discarded
him as quite impracticable.... After much farther discussion
it was agreed that Lord Lansdowne should go up to
Town this day, see first Lord Palmerston, then the Peelites,
and lastly Lord John, and come to Buckingham Palace at
two o'clock, prepared to give answers upon the question what
was feasible and what not. He inclines to the belief that we
shall have to go through the ceremony at least of entrusting
Lord John with the formation of an Administration.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John was not without large following amongst the
Whigs, and whatever was said about his late conduct in the
higher circles, he believed that it is well looked upon by the
lower classes. His expression was, that it would be found
that the first and second class carriages in the railway train
held opposite opinions.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>2nd February 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Lansdowne arrived at two o'clock, and reported that
he had seen all the persons intended, but he could not say
that he saw his way more clearly. They all gave pledges
generally to support any Government, but were full of difficulties
as to their participation in one.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Gladstone would clearly not serve under Lord John&mdash;might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.87" id="pageiii.87"></a>[page&nbsp;87]</span>
possibly with him&mdash;if much pressed by Lord Aberdeen
to do so. He would probably serve under Lord Palmerston.
Mr S. Herbert expressed apprehension at the effect upon the
prospects of peace which would be produced by Lord Palmerston's
being at the head of the Government.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell would not serve under Lord Palmerston,
and fancies he might form a Whig Administration himself, of
which Lord Palmerston, however, must be the chief member.
Lord Palmerston would not like to serve under Lord John
Russell&mdash;would be ready to form an Administration, which
could not have duration, however, in his opinion, if Lord John
Russell held aloof!</p>

<p class="ind">He found Lord John fully impressed with the fact of his
having brought the Queen into all these difficulties, and of
owing her what reparation he could make. Lord Palmerston
also felt that he had some amends to make to the Queen for
former offences. We asked Lord Lansdowne whether they
could not be combined under a third person. He felt embarrassed
about the answer, having to speak of himself.
Both expressed their willingness to serve under him&mdash;but then
he was seventy-five years old, and crippled with the gout, and
could not possibly undertake such a task except for a few
months, when the whole Administration would break down&mdash;of
which he did not wish to be the cause. In such a case,
Lord John had stated to him that the man to be Leader of the
House of Commons was Lord Palmerston, meaning himself to
be transferred to the House of Lords, in his former office as
President of the Council.</p>

<p class="ind">Without presuming to give advice, Lord Lansdowne thought
that under all circumstances it would do good if the Queen
was to see Lord John Russell, and hear from himself what he
could do. She could perfectly keep it in her power to commission
whom she pleased hereafter, even if Lord John should
declare himself willing to form a Government.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has just seen Lord Lansdowne. As what he

<span class="rightnote">INTERVIEW WITH LORD JOHN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>2nd February 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell came at five o'clock.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen said she wished to consult him on the present
crisis, and hear from him how the position of Parties stood at
this moment. He said that immediately at the meeting of
Parliament a general desire became manifest for a modification
of the Government; that the Protectionists were as hostile
to the Peelites as they had been in the year '46; that the old
Whigs had with difficulty been made to support the late Government;
that the dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war
was general, and the country cried out for Lord Palmerston
at the War Department; that he considered it of the greatest
importance that Lord Clarendon should remain at the Foreign
Office, where he had gained great reputation, and nobody could
replace him. On the question whether Lord Palmerston would
be supported if he formed an Administration, he said everybody
would give a general support, but he doubted the Whigs joining
him. He did not know what the Peelites would do, but they
would be an essential element in the Government, particularly
Mr Gladstone; the best thing would be if Lord Palmerston took
the lead of the House of Commons. A Government formed by
Lord Lansdowne or Lord Clarendon would ensure general
support, but Lord Lansdowne had declared that he would not
undertake it for more than three months, and then the Government
would break down again; and we objected that Lord
Clarendon ought, as he had said, not to be moved from the
Foreign Office, to which he agreed. He himself would prefer
to sit on the Fourth Bench and support the Government. The
Queen asked him whether he thought he could form a Government.
After having taken some time for reflection, he said
he thought he could,<sup>24</sup> but he thought it difficult without the
Peelites, and next to impossible without Lord Palmerston;<span class="rightnote">NEGOTIATIONS</span>
he did not know whether both or either would serve with or
under him; he would offer Lord Palmerston the choice between
the Lead of the House of Commons and the War Department&mdash;and
in case he should choose the former, ask himself to be
removed to the House of Lords; he had been Leader of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.89" id="pageiii.89"></a>[page&nbsp;89]</span>
House of Commons since '34, and as far as being able to support
his title, he was enabled to do so, as his brother, the Duke of
Bedford, intended to leave an estate of &pound;5000 a year to his son.
The Queen asked him whether he would do the same under the
Administration of Lord Lansdowne, for instance; he begged
to be allowed time to consider that. He acknowledged to the
Queen&mdash;on her remark that he had contributed to bring her into
the present difficulties&mdash;that he was bound to do what he could
to help her out of them; and on the Queen's question what he
could do, he answered that depended very much on what the
Queen would wish him to do.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 23: This Memorandum, though signed by the Queen, was written by the Prince.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 24: Colonel Phipps thus describes Lord Aberdeen's comment on Lord John Russell's
words:&mdash;"I told Lord Aberdeen that Lord John had said that he thought that he could
form a Government. He laughed very much, and said: 'I am not at all surprised at
that, but whom will he get to serve under him? Has he at present any idea of the
extent of the feeling that exists against him?' I replied that I thought not, that it was
difficult for anybody to tell him, but that I thought that it was right that he should know
what the feeling was, and that he would soon discover it when he began to ask people
to join his Government. Lord Aberdeen said that was very true...."
</p>

<p class="ind">She commissioned him finally to meet Lord Lansdowne and
Lord Palmerston, to consult together, and to let Lord Lansdowne
bring her the result of their deliberation this evening,
so that she might see a little more clearly where the prospect of
a strong Government lay.</p>

<p class="ind">We had some further discussion upon Mr Roebuck's Committee,
which he thinks will not be as inconvenient as all his
friends suppose. It would meet with great difficulties, and
might be precluded from drawing up a report. On Lord Grey's
Motion<sup>25</sup> and the Army question he declared that he held to his
Memorandum of the 22nd January which the Duke of Newcastle
had read to the House of Lords, and acknowledged the
necessity of maintaining the office of the Commander-in-Chief,
although subordinate to the Secretary of State, and retaining
the Army Patronage distinct from the Political Patronage of
the Government.</p>

whether Lord Clarendon would serve under Lord Palmerston,
answered that he could not at all say whether he would;
he had mentioned to him the possibility, when Lord Clarendon
drew up and made a long face.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has just seen Lord Lansdowne after his return
from his conference with Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston.
As moments are precious, and the time is rolling on
without the various consultations which Lord Lansdowne
has had the kindness and patience to hold with the various
persons composing the Queen's late Government having led
to any positive result, she feels that she ought to entrust some
one of them with the distinct commission to attempt the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.90" id="pageiii.90"></a>[page&nbsp;90]</span>
formation of a Government. The Queen addresses herself in
this instance to Lord John Russell, as the person who may be
considered to have contributed to the vote of the House of
Commons, which displaced her late Government, and hopes
that he will be able to present her such a Government as will
give a fair promise successfully to overcome the great difficulties
in which the country is placed. It would give her particular
satisfaction if Lord Palmerston could join in this formation.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S ATTEMPT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Chesham Place</span>, <i>2nd February 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He acknowledges that having contributed to the vote of the
House of Commons, which displaced your Majesty's late
Government (although the decision would in any case have
probably been unfavourable), he is bound to attempt the
formation of a Government.</p>

<p class="ind">As your Majesty has now entrusted him with this honourable
task, and desired that Lord Palmerston should join in it, Lord
John Russell will immediately communicate with Lord Palmerston,
and do his utmost to form a Government which will give
a fair promise to overcome the difficulties by which the country
is surrounded.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell considers Lord Clarendon's co-operation
in this task as absolutely essential.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by the Prince Albert.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>3rd February 1855.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell arrived at half-past one o'clock, and
stated that he had to report some progress and some obstacles.
He had been to Lord Palmerston, and had a long and very free
discussion with him. He (Lord Palmerston) told him
although the general voice of the public had pointed him out as
the person who ought to form a Government, he had no pretensions
himself or personal views, and was quite ready to
accept the lead of the House of Commons under Lord John in
the House of Lords; but that he thought that, if the Queen
would see him, now that she had seen Lord Derby, Lord John,
and Lord Lansdowne, it would remove any impression that
there were personal objections to him entertained by the Queen,
which would much facilitate the position of the new Government.
They then discussed the whole question of offices,
agreed that Lord Panmure would be the best person for the
War Department; that Lord Grey could not be asked to join,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.91" id="pageiii.91"></a>[page&nbsp;91]</span>
as his views on the Foreign Policy differed so much from theirs,
and he had always been an intractable colleague; that if Mr
Gladstone could not be prevailed upon to join, Mr Labouchere,<sup>26</sup>
although an infinitely weaker appointment, might be Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and Sir F. Baring replace Sir J. Graham,
if he could not be got to stay.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 26: He had been President of the Board of Trade in the former administration of Lord
John Russell.
</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John then saw Mr S. Herbert, who declared to him
that it was impossible for any of the Peelites to join his Government,
connected as they were with Lord Aberdeen and the
Duke of Newcastle, but that they would infinitely prefer a
Government of Lord John's to one of Lord Palmerston, whose
views on Foreign Policy, uncontrolled by Lord Aberdeen, they
sincerely dreaded.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John then went to Lord Clarendon, and was surprised
to find that he could not make up his mind to remain at the
Foreign Office under his Government. Lord John thought
that the expression of a wish on the part of the Queen would go
a great way to reconcile him. His objections were that he had
always received the handsomest support from the Peelites, and
thought the Government too weak without their administrative
ability.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John had seen none of his own friends, such as Sir G.
Grey, Sir C. Wood, Lord Lansdowne, and Lord Granville, but
had not the smallest doubt that they would cordially co-operate
with him.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John is to come again at a quarter before six o'clock.
The Queen has appointed Lord Palmerston for three o'clock,
and Lord Clarendon at four.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>3rd February 1855.</i></p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 27: This Memorandum, though signed by the Queen, was written by the Prince.
</p>

<p class="ind">In the Audience which the Queen has just granted to Lord
Palmerston, he thanked her for the message which she had sent
him through Lord John Russell, and declared his readiness to
serve her in any way he could under the present difficulties.
He had preferred the lead of the House of Commons to the War
Department, having to make a choice between two duties
which no man could perform together.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE FOREIGN OFFICE</span>
<p class="ind">In answer to a question from the Queen, he said he hoped
that the present irritation in the Whig party would subside,
and that he would be able to complete a Government. He regretted
that the Peelites thought it impossible for them to join,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.92" id="pageiii.92"></a>[page&nbsp;92]</span>
which would make it very difficult for Lord John. He had just
heard from Count Walewski that Lord Clarendon was very
much disinclined to remain at the Foreign Office under Lord
John. They were to have a meeting at Lord John's at five,
where he hoped to find that he had waived his objections;
but he must say that if Lord Clarendon persisted he must himself
withdraw, as he had indeed made it a condition with Lord
John. The Queen asked him whether, if this attempt failed,
she could reckon upon his services in any other combination.
His answer was that it was better not to answer for more than
one question at a time; we must now suppose that this will
succeed.</p>

<p class="ind">What he stated with reference to the Army question and the
Committee of the House of Commons was perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD CLARENDON</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon, whom we saw at four o'clock, complained
very much of the unfairness of Lord John in making him personally
answerable for impeding the progress of Lord John's
Government. The fact was that his opinion was only that of
every other member of the late Government, and of the public
at large; which could be heard and seen by anybody who chose
to listen or to read. So impossible had it appeared to the
public that Lord John should be blind enough to consider his
being able to form a Government feasible, that it was generally
supposed that he had been urged to do so by the Queen, in
order to escape the necessity of Lord Palmerston. He acknowledged
that the Queen's decision in that respect had been
the perfectly correct and constitutional one, and perhaps
necessary to clear the way; but he hoped that for her own sake,
and to prevent false impressions taking root in the public mind,
the Queen would give afterwards Lord Palmerston his fair turn
also, though he could not say that he would be able to form
an Administration. The Queen said that this was her intention,
that she never had expected that Lord John would be
able to form one, but that it was necessary that his eyes should
be opened; Lord Clarendon only regretted the precious time
that was lost.</p>

<p class="ind">He must really say that he thought he could do no good in
joining Lord John; his Government would be "a stillborn
Government," which "the country would tread under foot the
first day," composed as it would be of the same men who had
been bankrupt in 1852, minus the two best men in it, viz. Lord
Lansdowne and Lord Grey, and the head of it ruined in public
opinion. If he were even to stay at the Foreign Office, his
language to foreign countries would lose all its weight from being
known not to rest upon the public opinion of England, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.93" id="pageiii.93"></a>[page&nbsp;93]</span>
this would become much worse when it became known that from
the first day of Lord John's entering into Lord Aberdeen's
Government, he had only had one idea, viz. that of tripping
him up, expel the Peelites, and place himself at the head of an
exclusive Whig Ministry. Besides, he felt that the conduct of
all his colleagues had been most straightforward and honourable
towards him, and he was not prepared "to step over their dead
bodies to the man who had killed them." The attempt of
Lord John ought <i>not</i> to succeed if public morality were to be
upheld in this country. He had avoided Lord John ever since
his retirement, but he would have now to speak out to him, as
when he was asked to embark his honour he had a right to
count the cost.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Lansdowne had no intention to go to Lord John's
meeting, as he had originally taken leave of public life, and had
only entered the Coalition Government in order to facilitate
its cohesion; among a Government of pure Whigs he was not
wanted, for there was no danger of their not <i>cohering</i>. Sir C.
Wood declared he had no business to be where Lord Lansdowne
refused to go in.</p>

<p class="ind">He thought Lord Palmerston would have equal difficulty in
forming an administration, but when that had failed some solid
combination would become possible.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Lansdowne had declared that he could not place himself
at the head for more than three months, but that was a long
time in these days.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">FRESH DIFFICULTIES</span>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell returned at six o'clock from his meeting,
much put out and disturbed. He said he had nothing good
to report. Mr Gladstone, whom he had seen, had declined to
act with him, saying that the country did not wish for Coalitions
at this moment. Sir J. Graham, whom he had visited, had
informed him that the feeling against him was very strong just
now, precluding support in Parliament; he gave him credit
for good intentions, but said the whole difficulty was owing
to what he termed his (Lord John's) <i>rashness</i>. He felt he could
not separate from Lord Aberdeen, and had no confidence in the
views of Foreign Affairs of Lord Palmerston.</p>

<p class="ind">He had then seen Sir George Grey, who told him he had no
idea that a Government of Lord John's could stand at this
moment; the country wanted Lord Palmerston either as War
Minister or as Prime Minister. He must hesitate to engage
himself in Lord John's Government, which, separated from the
Peelites, would find no favour. Lord Clarendon had reiterated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.94" id="pageiii.94"></a>[page&nbsp;94]</span>
his objections, saying always that this must be gone through,
and something new would come up at the end, when all these
attempts had failed. He could not understand what this should
be. Did Lord Clarendon think of himself as the head of the
new combination? I asked what Lord Lansdowne had said.
He answered he had a letter from him, which was not very
agreeable either. He read it to us. It was to the purport&mdash;that
as Lord John had been commissioned to form an Administration,
and he did not intend to join it, he thought it better
not to come to his house in order to avoid misconstruction.
Lord John wound up, saying that he had asked Lord Clarendon
and Sir G. Grey to reflect further, and to give their final answer
to-morrow morning. The loss of the Peelites would be a great
blow to him, which might be overcome, however; but if his
own particular friends, like Lord Clarendon and Sir G. Grey,
deserted him, he felt that he could go on no farther, and he
hoped the Queen would feel that he had done all he could.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Lansdowne arrived at half-past nine in the evening,
and met our question whether he had anything satisfactory to
report, with the remark that he saw his way less than ever, and
that matters had rather gone backward since he had been here
in the morning. He had been in the afternoon at Sir James
Graham's bedside, who had had a consultation with Mr Gladstone,
and declared to him that the country was tired of Coalitions,
and wanted a united Cabinet; that they (the Peelites)
could not possibly serve under Lord John or even with him
after what had happened; that he felt the strongest objections
to serving under Lord Palmerston. They were one and all for
the vigorous prosecution of the war, but in order to attain a
speedy peace. Lord Palmerston was known to entertain ulterior
views, on which he was secretly agreed with the Emperor of the
French; and when it came to the question of negotiations, the
Government was sure to break up on a ground most dangerous
to the country. Lord Lansdowne could but agree in all this,
and added he had been tempted to feel his pulse to know how
much it had gone down since he had been with Sir James.</p>

<p class="ind">The meeting between Lord Palmerston and Lord John had

most openly, but being both very guarded to say nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.95" id="pageiii.95"></a>[page&nbsp;95]</span>
which could lead the other to believe that the one would serve
under the other. He confessed everything was darker now
than before. They both seemed to wish to form a Government,
but he could really not advise the Queen what to do under
the circumstances.</p>

<p class="ind">I summed up that the Queen appeared to me reduced to the
necessity of now entrusting one of the two with a <i>positive</i>
commission. It was very important that it should not appear
that the Queen had any personal objection to Lord Palmerston;
on the other hand, under such doubtful circumstances, it would
be safest for the Queen to follow that course which was clearly
the most constitutional, and this was, after having failed with
Lord Derby, to go to Lord John, who was the other party to the
destruction of the late Government. The Queen might write
such a letter to Lord John as would record the political reasons
which led to her determination. Lord Lansdowne highly
approved of this, and suggested the addition of an expression
of the Queen's hope of seeing Lord Palmerston associated in
that formation.</p>

<p class="ind">I drew up the annexed draft which Lord Lansdowne read
over and entirely approved.</p>

<p class="ind">He has no idea that Lord John will succeed in his task, but
thinks it a necessary course to go through, and most wholesome
to Lord John to have his eyes opened to his own position, of
which he verily believed he was not the least aware.</p>

consider the exact moment at which to offer it to him, as Sir

Russell will probably have to give up the task of forming an

levelled. Viscount Palmerston has not yet been able to ascertain
the decision of Sir James Graham, but it will probably
be the same as that of his three colleagues.</p>

<p class="ind">We came to Town to hear the result of negotiations, and saw
Lord Palmerston at one o'clock. He said there were circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.98" id="pageiii.98"></a>[page&nbsp;98]</span>
which prevented him from submitting a List of the
Cabinet, but would at all events be able to do so in the afternoon.</p>

<p class="ind">Lords Lansdowne, Clarendon, Granville, Sir G. Grey, Sir C.
Wood, Sir William Molesworth, and the Chancellor had consented
to serve&mdash;unconditionally&mdash;having withdrawn their
former conditions in consequence of the very general opinion
expressed out of doors that the country could not much longer
be left without a Government. He heard this had also made
an impression upon the Peelites, who had refused to join. He
submitted their letters (declining) to the Queen, of which copies
are here annexed. They had been written after consultation
with Sir J. Graham, but Lord Aberdeen and the Duke of Newcastle
having heard of it, have since exerted themselves strongly
to prevail upon them to change their opinion, and it was still
possible that they would do so. Lord Clarendon had suggested
that if Lord Aberdeen himself was invited to join the Government,
and could be induced to do so, this would obviate all
difficulty. He had in consequence asked Lord Lansdowne to
see Lord Aberdeen on the subject, as his joining could only be
agreeable to him. Many of the Peelites not in the late Cabinet
had strongly disapproved of the decision taken by Mr Gladstone
and friends, and offered their services, amongst others Lord
Canning, Lord Elcho,<sup>30</sup> and Mr Cardwell.</p>

declined, however, saying he preferred to stay out of office and
to remain in the House of Commons, which Lord Palmerston
obviously much regretted. They went, however, together all

union of my friends with the new Government may be attained
without the painful sacrifice to which your Royal Highness

I am concerned.</p>

<p class="ind">I venture to enclose the copy of a letter which I addressed to

<span class="rightnote">MR SIDNEY HERBERT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Argyll House</span>, <i>6th February 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Herbert</span>,&mdash;I received your letter too late to answer it
last night. In fact, I had gone to bed.</p>

<p class="ind">You say that you are in a great difficulty as to the course you ought
to take. I am in none whatever.</p>

<p class="ind">I gave you my decided opinion yesterday that you ought to continue
in Palmerston's Administration; and I endeavoured to support
this opinion by the very arguments which you repeat in your letter
to me. Surely this letter ought to have been addressed to Gladstone
and Graham, and not to me. I fully concur in thinking that you
came to a wrong conclusion yesterday, and I would fain hope that it
would still be reversed.</p>

<p class="ind">When you sent to me yesterday to attend your meeting, I certainly
hoped it was with the intention of following my advice.</p>

<p class="ind">Your reluctance to continue in Palmerston's Cabinet is chiefly
founded on the apprehension that he will pursue a warlike policy
beyond reasonable bounds. I have already told you that I have had
some explanations with him on the terms of peace, with which I am
satisfied. But whatever may be his inclinations, you ought to rely on
the weight of your own character and opinions in the Cabinet. I am
persuaded that the sentiments of the great majority of the Members of
the Cabinet are similar to your own, and that you may fairly expect
reason and sound policy to prevail in the question of peace and war.</p>

<p class="ind">But above all I have recently had some very full conversations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.100" id="pageiii.100"></a>[page&nbsp;100]</span>
with Clarendon on the subject, and I am entirely satisfied with his
disposition and intentions. I am sanguine in the belief that he will
give effect to his present views.</p>

<p class="ind">A perseverance in the refusal to join Palmerston will produce very
serious effects, and will never be attributed to its true cause. The
public feeling will be strongly pronounced against you, and you will
greatly suffer in reputation, if you persevere at such a moment as this
in refusing to continue in the Cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind">In addition to the public necessity, I think you owe much to our
late Whig colleagues, who behaved so nobly and generously towards
us after Lord John's resignation. They have some right to expect
this sacrifice.</p>

<p class="ind">Although your arguments do not apply to me, for I yesterday
adopted them all, you conclude your letter by pressing me to enter
the Cabinet. Now there is really no sense in this, and I cannot
imagine how you can seriously propose it. You would expose me
to a gratuitous indignity, to which no one ought to expect me to
submit. I say <i>gratuitous</i>, because I could not be of the slightest
use in such a situation for the purpose you require.</p>

<p class="ind">I can retire with perfect equanimity from the Government in consequence
of the vote of the House of Commons; but to be stigmatised
as the Head and tolerated as the subordinate member I cannot
endure.</p>

<p class="ind">If at any future time my presence should be required in a Cabinet,
I should feel no objection to accept any office, or to enter it without
office. But to be the Head of a Cabinet to-day, and to become a
subordinate member of the very same Cabinet to-morrow, would be
a degradation to which I could never submit, that I would rather
die than do so&mdash;and indeed the sense of it would go far to kill me.</p>

<p class="ind">If you tell me that your retaining your present offices, without the
slightest sacrifice, but on the contrary with the approbation of all, is
in any degree to depend on my taking such a course, I can only say
that, as friends, I cannot believe it possible that you should be guilty
of such wanton cruelty without any national object.</p>

<p class="ind">I must, then, again earnestly exhort you to reconsider the decision
of yesterday, and to continue to form part of the Government. I
will do anything in my power to facilitate this. If you like, I will
go to Palmerston and promote any explanation between him and
Gladstone on the subject of peace and war. Or I will tell him that
you have yielded to my strong recommendation. In short, I am
ready to do anything in my power.</p>

<p class="ind">I wish you to show this letter to Gladstone and to Graham, to
whom, as you will see, it is addressed as much as to yourself.</p>

<p class="ind">I hope to meet you this morning, and Gladstone will also come to
the Admiralty. Yours, etc.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LEADERSHIP OF THE LORDS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>7th February 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that a difficulty has arisen in regard
to the reconstruction of the Administration, which your
Majesty might perhaps be able to assist in removing. It is
considered by the Members of the proposed Cabinet to be a
matter of great importance that Lord Lansdowne should not
only be a Member of the Cabinet, but that he should also be
the Organ of the Government in the House of Lords.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston pressed this upon Lord Lansdowne
yesterday afternoon, and was under the impression that Lord
Lansdowne had consented to be so acknowledged, with the
understanding that Lord Granville, as President of the Council,
should relieve him from the pressure of the daily business of
the House, while Lord Clarendon would take the burthen of
Foreign Office discussions, and that thus the ordinary duties
of Leader of the House of Lords would be performed by
others, while Lord Lansdowne would still be the directing
chief, who would give a character and tone to the body. But
Viscount Palmerston learns this morning from Lord Granville
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.103" id="pageiii.103"></a>[page&nbsp;103]</span>
and Lord Bessborough that Lord Lansdowne does not so
understand the matter, and is unwilling to assume the ostensible
Leadership, even upon the above-mentioned arrangement, and
that he wishes Lord Granville to be the Leader in the House of
Lords.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Granville, however, with reason urges that there are
many members of the House of Lords who would show to Lord
Lansdowne, from his long standing and high political position,
a deference which they would not show towards Lord
Granville, so much younger a man. If Lord Lansdowne
were in Town, Viscount Palmerston would have gone to him
strongly to entreat him to be the person to announce in the
House of Lords the formation of a Ministry, and to continue to
be the organ of the Government in that House, at least till
Easter, and upon such matters and occasions as might require
the weight of his authority; but if your Majesty were to view
the matter in the same light in which it has presented itself to
Viscount Palmerston, to the Chancellor, to Lord Clarendon,
to Lord Granville and others, and if your Majesty should think
fit to express an opinion upon it to Lord Lansdowne, such an
opinion would no doubt have great weight with Lord Lansdowne.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston submits a list of the proposed Cabinet.
Until Sir George Grey returns to Town this afternoon from
Portsmouth, whither he went yesterday evening to take leave
of his son, who has a commission in the Rifles,<sup>32</sup> and was to
embark this morning for the Crimea, Viscount Palmerston will
not know whether he prefers the Colonial Office or the Home
Office. Whichever of the two he chooses, Mr Herbert will
take the other. Viscount Palmerston does not submit to your
Majesty the name of any person for the office of Secretary at
War, as he proposes that that office shall merge in the office
of Secretary of State for the War Department, and Viscount
Palmerston suspends for the present any recommendation to
your Majesty for the office of Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, as that office may be made available for giving
strength either in the House of Lords or in the House of Commons
according to circumstances.</p>

agrees with him in the view he takes with respect to Lord
Lansdowne's position in the House of Lords, and will write

the announcement of the Government as well as to take the

Lord Henry Petty, been Chancellor of the Exchequer in the ministry of "All the Talents"

private correspondence which Lord Palmerston means to
establish with the Emperor Napoleon is a novel and unconstitutional
practice. If carried on behind the back of the

with whom he communicated in the course of the evening,
including the Speaker, that the appointment of the Committee
will be carried by a very great majority, perhaps scarcely less
great than that by which the original Motion was affirmed;
and it was also the opinion of good judges that a refusal to
grant an enquiry would not be a good ground on which to dissolve
Parliament and appeal to the Country. The general
opinion was that the best way of meeting the Motion for
naming the Committee which Mr Roebuck has fixed for next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.107" id="pageiii.107"></a>[page&nbsp;107]</span>
Thursday, would be to move some instruction to the Committee
directing or limiting the range of its enquiry. This is

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by the Prince Albert.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">MR GLADSTONE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>21st February 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">I have just seen Mr Gladstone, who received my box so late
that I did not wish to detain him more than a few minutes,
as the Cabinet was waiting for him. I told him, however, the
substance of Lord Palmerston's letter, and of the Queen's
answer, the wisdom of which, he said, nobody could doubt for
a moment, and added that the choice lying only between many
evils, I hoped he and his friends would not strive to obtain an
absolute good, and thereby lose the Queen the services of an
efficient Government. He begged that I should rest assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.108" id="pageiii.108"></a>[page&nbsp;108]</span>
that the first and primary consideration which would guide
their determination would be the position of the Crown in
these critical circumstances. He had had no opportunity of
consulting these last days either Mr S. Herbert or Sir James
Graham. But for himself he felt the greatest difficulty in
letting the House of Commons succeed in what he must consider
a most unconstitutional, most presumptuous, and most
dangerous course, after which it would be impossible for the
Executive ever to oppose again the most absurd and preposterous
demands for enquiry.<sup>37</sup></p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 37: See <i>post</i>, <a href="#pageiii.109" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 109</a>, note 38.
</p>

<p class="ind">I asked, "But can you stop it?"</p>

<p class="ind">He answered: I believe Lord Palmerston made a mistake
in not grappling with it from the first, and using all the power
the Crown had entrusted to him, even ostentatiously, for the
purpose. Now it might be most difficult&mdash;but it ought not
to pass without a solemn protest on the part of the men who
were not connected with the Government, and should not be
supposed to have any other than the interests of the Country
at heart. A Government was powerless in resisting such an
encroachment of the House, where the whole Opposition, from
personal motives, and the supporters of Government from fear
of their constituents, were bent upon carrying it. Such a
protest, however, might form a rallying-point upon which
future resistance might be based, and the Country, now intoxicated
by agitation, might come to its senses.</p>

<p class="ind">As to the strength of the Government, he believed it had
very little at this moment in the House, and that such would
be the case with any Government Lord Palmerston could form,
he had foretold him, when Lord Derby had made him the offer
to join an Administration of his forming. At this moment the
secession of the Peelites would rather strengthen the Government
than otherwise, as, from their connection with Lord
Aberdeen, they had been decried in the Country with him,
and the Whigs looked upon them with all the personal feelings
of men deprived of their offices by them.</p>

<p class="ind">He agreed with me that in the present disruption of Parties,
the difficulty of obtaining any strong Government consists,
not in the paucity of men, but in the over-supply of Right
Honourable gentlemen produced by the many attempts to
form a Government on a more extended base. There were
now at least three Ministers for each office, from which the two
excluded were always cried up as superior to the one in power.
He said this could not be amended until we got back to two
Parties&mdash;each of them capable of presenting to the Queen an
efficient Administration. Now the one Party did not support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.109" id="pageiii.109"></a>[page&nbsp;109]</span>
its Chief from personal rivalry&mdash;and the other, from the very feeling
of its own incapacity, became reckless as to the course
of its political actions.</p>

<p class="ind">He concluded by saying he felt it right to reserve his final
determination till the last moment at which it would become
necessary.</p>

<span class="rightnote">RESIGNATION OF THE PEELITES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>21st February 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and feels extreme regret in having to state to your
Majesty that Sir James Graham, Mr Gladstone, and Mr Sidney
Herbert announced at the Cabinet Meeting to-day their determination
to retire from the Government in consequence of
their inability to consent to the nomination of Mr Roebuck's
Committee.<sup>38</sup> <i>No other</i> Member of the Government has as yet
intimated any intention to retire. Viscount Palmerston will
assemble the remaining Members of the Government to-morrow
at twelve to take into consideration the steps to be
taken for supplying the places of the retiring Members.<sup>39</sup></p>

<p class="ind">An endeavour has been made to induce Mr Roebuck to postpone
the appointment of the Committee till Monday, but he
will not consent to delay it beyond to-morrow, and he will
insert in the votes to-night, to be printed to-morrow morning
(in accordance with the rules of the House), the proposed list
of names which have been settled between the Government
and Mr Roebuck, and which seem to be unobjectionable, all
things considered....</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 38: The retirement of the Peelites in a body from Lord Palmerston's Ministry is a curious
instance of the tenacity of Party ties, since the prosecution of the enquiry into the conduct
of the war affected the Whig as much as the Peelite section of the Aberdeen Cabinet.
In reference to their reason for resignation (<i>viz.</i> that the investigation was a dangerous
breach of a great constitutional principle, and that similar enquiries could never thenceforward
be refused), see Parker's <i>Sir James Graham</i>, vol. ii. pp. 268-272.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">The secession of the Peelites, however, did not make the Ministry a Whig Government.
The last Whig Administration was that which left office early in 1852. Had Lord John
Russell succeeded in his attempt on the present occasion, the Whig party might have
endured <i>co nomine</i>; but Palmerston had, notwithstanding Cobden's distrust, been
popular with the Radicals, and henceforward his supporters must be known as the Liberal
Party.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 39: Sir Charles Wood became First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Vernon Smith succeeding
him at the Board of Control), Sir George Lewis succeeded Mr Gladstone at the Exchequer,
and the Colonial Office was offered to and accepted by Lord John Russell, who was at
the moment in Paris on his way to attend the Vienna Conference.

A great many of them, I am glad to say, will be able to remain
in the Service. Those who have lost their limbs cannot, of
course. There were two poor boys of nineteen and twenty&mdash;the
one had lost his leg, quite high up, by the bursting of a shell
in the trenches, and the other his poor arm so shot that it is
perfectly useless. Both had smooth girls' faces; these were
in the Coldstream, who certainly look the worst. In the Scotch
Fusileers, there were also two very young men&mdash;the one shot
through the cheek, the other through the <i>skull</i>&mdash;but both
recovered! Among the Grenadiers there is one very sad
object, shot <i>dreadfully</i>, a ball having gone in through the cheek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.111" id="pageiii.111"></a>[page&nbsp;111]</span>
and behind the nose and eye and out through the other side!
He is shockingly disfigured, but is recovered. I feel so much
for them, and am <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'so-fond'"><i>so fond</i></ins> of my dear soldiers&mdash;so <i>proud</i> of them!

which had been carefully matured, was arrived at in full loyalty to the Alliance with
this country, and had to be tactfully met. Accordingly, it was arranged that when
Napoleon was at the Camp in Boulogne in March, Lord Clarendon should visit him there,
and discuss the question with him. Eventually, the Foreign Secretary persuaded the
Emperor to relinquish, or at any rate defer, his expedition; a memorandum of what
passed on the occasion was drawn up by the Prince from the narration of Lord
Clarendon, and printed by Sir Theodore Martin. (<i>Life of the Prince Consort</i>, vol. iii.

<span class="rightnote">THE COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">House of Commons</span>, <i>2nd March 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty....</p>

<p class="ind">The death of the Emperor of Russia may or may not produce
important changes in the state of affairs. It is probable that
the Grand Duke Hereditary will succeed quietly, notwithstanding
the notion that a doubt would be started whether he,
as son of the Grand Duke Nicholas, would not be superseded by
his younger brother born son of the Czar.<sup>44</sup> It is possible that
the new Emperor may revert to that peaceful policy which he
was understood to advocate in the beginning of these transactions,
but it is possible, on the other hand, that he may feel
bound to follow out the policy of his father, and may be impelled
by the headstrong ambition of his brother Constantine. At
all events, this change at Petersburg should not for the present
slacken the proceedings and the arrangements of the Allies.</p>

<p class="ind">The House of Commons has been engaged in discussing Mr
Roebuck's proposal that the Committee of Enquiry should be
a secret one. This proposal was made by the majority of the
Committee on the ground that they anticipated a difficulty in
conducting their enquiries without trenching on the delicate
and dangerous ground of questioning the proceedings of the
French. The proposal was objected to by Lord Seymour<sup>45</sup>
and Mr Ellice, members of the Committee, by Sir James
Graham as unjust towards the Duke of Newcastle, and others
whose conduct ought to be enquired into with all the safeguards
which publicity secures for justice, and not before a
Secret Tribunal in the nature of an Inquisition. The general
sense of the House was against secrecy, and Viscount Palmerston
expressed an opinion adverse to it, on the ground that it
could not be enforced because the Committee could not gag
the witnesses, and that the character of secrecy would excite
suspicion and disappoint public expectation. Sir John Pakington,
a member of the Committee, was for secrecy, Mr Disraeli
spoke against it, and the Motion has been withdrawn.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>4th March 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Dear Augusta</span>,&mdash;The astounding news of the death of your
poor uncle the Emperor Nicholas reached us the day before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.113" id="pageiii.113"></a>[page&nbsp;113]</span>
yesterday at four o'clock. A few hours previously we had
learnt that his condition was hopeless. The news is sudden and
most unexpected, and we are naturally very anxious to learn
details. His departure from life at the present moment cannot
but make a particularly strong impression, and what the consequences
of it may be the All-knowing One alone can foresee.
Although the poor Emperor has died as our enemy, I have not
forgotten former and more happy times, and no one has more
than I regretted that he himself evoked this sad war.<sup>46</sup> To
you I must address my request to express to the poor Empress,
as well as to the family, my heartfelt condolence. I cannot do
it officially, but you, my beloved friend, you will surely be able
to convey it to your sister-in-law as well as to the present young
Emperor in a manner which shall not compromise me. I have
a deep, heartfelt desire to express this. To your dear, honoured
mother convey, pray, my condolence on the death of her
brother....</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 46: The Queen records, in the <i>Life of the Prince Consort</i>, that she entertained a sincere
respect for the Emperor personally, and received the news of his death with regret (vol.
iii. p. 225, note).
</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure.</i></h5><span class="rightnote">THE HOSPITAL QUESTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>5th March 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is very anxious to bring before Lord Panmure the
subject which she mentioned to him the other night, viz. that
of Hospitals for our sick and wounded soldiers. This is absolutely
necessary, and <i>now</i> is the moment to have them built,
for no doubt there would be no difficulty in obtaining the
money requisite for this purpose, from the strong feeling now
existing in the public mind for improvements of all kinds connected
with the Army and the well-being and comfort of the
soldier.</p>

<p class="ind">Nothing can exceed the attention paid to these poor men in
the Barracks at Chatham (or rather more Fort Pitt and Brompton),
and they are in that respect very comfortable; but the
buildings are bad&mdash;the wards more like prisons than hospitals,
with the windows so high that no one can look out of them;
and the generality of the wards are small rooms, with hardly
space for you to walk between the beds. There is no dining-room
or hall, so that the poor men must have their dinners in
the same room in which they sleep, and in which some may be
dying, and at any rate many suffering, while others are at their
meals. The proposition of having hulks prepared for their
reception will do very well at first, but it would not, the Queen
thinks, do for any length of time. A hulk is a very gloomy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.114" id="pageiii.114"></a>[page&nbsp;114]</span>
place, and these poor men require their spirits to be cheered
as much as their physical sufferings to be attended to.
The Queen is particularly anxious on this subject, which is,
he may truly say, constantly in her thoughts, as is everything
connected with her beloved troops, who have fought
so bravely and borne so heroically all their sufferings and
privations.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes before long to visit all the Hospitals at
Portsmouth, and to see in what state they are.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General presents his most humble duty to
your Majesty; and in obedience to the command, which your
Majesty was pleased to lay upon him, that he should keep your
Majesty acquainted with the course of public events in India,
he has the honour to inform your Majesty that he has now felt
it to be his duty to request the President of the Board of Control
to solicit for him your Majesty's permission to retire from
the office of Governor-General of India about the close of the
present year.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General begs permission respectfully to represent,
that in January next, he will have held his present
office for eight years; that his health during the last few
months has seriously failed him; and that although he believes
that the invigorating air of these hills will enable him to discharge
all his duties efficiently during this season, yet he is
conscious that the effects of an Indian climate have laid such a
hold upon him that by the close of the present year he will be
wholly unfit any longer to serve your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Dalhousie, therefore, humbly trusts that your Majesty
will graciously permit him to resign the great office which he
holds before he ceases to command the strength which is
needed to sustain it. He has the honour to subscribe himself,

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the letter and Despatches from Vienna.
They don't alter her opinion as to our demands. Every concession
in form and wording ought to be made which could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.115" id="pageiii.115"></a>[page&nbsp;115]</span>
save Russian <i>amour-propre</i>; but this ought in no way to trench
upon the <i>substance</i> of our demands, to which Austria must feel
herself bound.<sup>47</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 47: As has already been stated, the "Four Points" were the basis of the negotiations
at Vienna; the third alone, which the Allies and Austria had defined as intended to

<span class="rightnote">THE VIENNA CONFERENCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>19th March 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has read with the greatest interest Lord Cowley's
three reports. The changeableness of the French views are
most perplexing, although they have hitherto not prevented a
steady course from being followed in the end. Lord Cowley
seems to have been a little off his guard when he took the proposal
of our taking Sinope as a second Malta or Gibraltar, for
a mere act of generosity and confidence towards us. We must
be careful not to break down ourselves the barrier of the
"abnegation clause" of our original treaty.<sup>48</sup> The Austrian
proposal can hardly be serious, for to require 1,200,000 men
before going to war is almost ridiculous.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen read with much concern the two simultaneous
proposals from the King of Prussia's simultaneous Plenipotentiaries&mdash;both
inadmissible, in her opinion. A very civil answer
would appear to the Queen as the best, to the effect that, as
Prussia was evidently not now in a mood to resume her position
amongst the great Powers with the responsibilities attaching
to it, we could not hope to arrive at any satisfactory result by
the present negotiations, but shall be ready to treat Prussia
with the same regard with which we have always done, when she
shall have something tangible to propose.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE BALTIC EXPEDITION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>19th March 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to the Expedition to the Baltic<sup>49</sup> the Queen
concurs in believing it probable that we shall have to confine
ourselves to a blockade, but this should be with the <i>certainty</i>
of its being done effectually and free from any danger to the
squadron, from a sudden start of the Russian fleet. Twenty
sail of the Line (to which add five French) would be a sufficient
force if supported by the necessary complement of frigates,
corvettes, and gunboats, etc., etc.; alone, they would be useless
from their draught of water, and if twenty ships only are meant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.116" id="pageiii.116"></a>[page&nbsp;116]</span>
(not sail of the Line), the force would seem wholly inadequate.
The Queen would therefore wish, before giving her sanction
to the proposed plan of campaign, to have a complete list submitted
to her of what it is intended to constitute the Baltic
Fleet.<sup>50</sup> We ought likewise not to leave ourselves destitute
of any Reserve at home, which the uncertain contingencies of
another year's war may call upon at any moment.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen regrets Lord Shaftesbury's declining office, and
approves of Lord Elgin's selection in his place.<sup>51</sup></p>

<p class="ind">She thanks Lord Palmerston for the clear and comprehensive
explanation of Sir George Lewis's Stamp Duties Bill,<sup>52</sup> and
approves of Lord Palmerston's proposal for the adjournment
of Parliament for the Easter holidays.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 49: The expedition was commanded by Rear-Admiral Richard Dundas. About the
same time Vice-Admiral Sir James Dundas retired from the Mediterranean Command,
in favour of Sir Edmund Lyons.</p>

the subject of the distribution of the <i>Medal</i> for the <i>Crimean</i>
Campaign amongst the Officers, and those who <i>are</i> in <i>this</i>

The Queen has since thought that the value of this Medal would
be greatly enhanced if <i>she</i>, were <i>personally</i> to deliver it to the
officers and a certain number of men (selected for that purpose).
The valour displayed by our troops, as well as the sufferings
they have endured, have never been surpassed&mdash;perhaps hardly
equalled; and as the Queen has been a witness of <i>what</i> they
have gone through, having visited them in their hospitals, she
would <i>like</i> to be able <i>personally</i> to give them the reward they
have earned so well, and will value so much. It will likewise
have a very beneficial effect, the Queen doubts not, on the
recruiting. The manner in which it should be done, and the details
connected with the execution of this intention of hers, the
Queen will settle with Lord Panmure, when she sees him in Town.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your

who met yesterday evening at the Chancellor's were of opinion
that the Austrian proposal adopted by M. Drouyn de Lhuys,<span class="rightnote">AUSTRIAN PROPOSALS</span>
even with his pretended modification, could not be described
more accurately than in the concise terms of H.R.H. the
Prince Albert, namely, that instead of making to cease the
preponderance of Russia in the Black Sea, it would perpetuate
and legalise that preponderance, and that instead of establishing
a secure and permanent Peace, it would only establish a
prospective case for war. Such a proposal therefore your
Majesty's Advisers could not recommend your Majesty to
adopt; but as the step to be taken seems rather to be to make
such a proposal to Austria than to answer such a proposal
which Austria has not formally made, and as M. Drouyn's
telegraphic despatch stated that he thought that Lord John
Russell would recommend such an arrangement to his colleagues,
the Cabinet were of opinion that the best course would be
simply to take no step at all until Lord John Russell's return,
which may be expected to-morrow or next day, especially as
Lord Clarendon had already, by telegraphic message of yesterday,
intimated to the French Government that such an arrangement
as that proposed by M. Drouyn, and which would
sanction a Russian Fleet in the Black Sea to any amount short
by one ship of the number existing in 1853, could not be
agreed to by the British Government. Such an arrangement
would, in the opinion of Viscount Palmerston, be alike dangerous
and dishonourable; and as to the accompanying alliance
with Austria for the future defence of Turkey and for making
war with Russia, if she were to raise her Black Sea Fleet up to
the amount of 1853, what reason is there to believe that Austria,
who shrinks from war with Russia now that the Army of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.121" id="pageiii.121"></a>[page&nbsp;121]</span>
Russia has been much reduced by the losses of the last twelve
months&mdash;now that her Forces are divided and occupied elsewhere
than on the Austrian frontier, and now that England
and France are actually in the field with great Armies, supported
by great Fleets, what reason is there to believe that this
same Austria would be more ready to make war four or five
years hence, when the Army of Russia shall have repaired its
losses and shall be more concentrated to attack Austria, when
the Austrian Army shall have been reduced to its Peace
Establishment, and when the Peace Establishments of England
and France, withdrawn within their home stations, shall
be less ready to co-operate with Austria in war? What
reason, moreover, is there for supposing that Austria, who has
recently declared that though prepared for war she will not
make war for ten sail of the Line more or less in the Russian
Black Sea Fleet, will some few years hence, when unprepared
for war, draw the sword on account of the addition of one ship
of war to the Russian Fleet in the Black Sea?</p>

<p class="ind">Such proposals are really a mockery.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;"><a id="footnoteXXIV55" name="footnoteXXIV55"></a>
<a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagXXIV55">Footnote 55:</a> It had long become evident that Russia would refuse assent to the Third Point, terminating
her preponderance in the Black Sea, but Austria now came forward with a proposal
to limit the Russian force there to the number of ships authorised before the war. This
was rejected by Russia, whereupon the representatives of England and France withdrew
from the negotiations. Count Buol, representing Austria, then came forward again with
a scheme the salient features of which were that, if Russia increased her Black Sea fleet
beyond its existing strength, Turkey might maintain a force equal to it, and England
and France might each have a naval force in the Black Sea equal to half the Russian
force, while the increase of the Russian fleet beyond its strength in 1853 would be
regarded by Austria as a <i>casus belli</i>. These terms were satisfactory neither to the British
Government nor to the French Emperor, so that it was learned with some surprise that
Lord John Russell and M. Drouyn de Lhuys (the French Plenipotentiary) had approved
of them. Upon the Emperor definitely rejecting the proposals, M. Drouyn de Lhuys
resigned; he was succeeded as Foreign Minister by Count Walewski, M. de Persigny
becoming Ambassador in London. Lord John Russell tendered his resignation, but, at
Lord Palmerston's solicitation, and most unfortunately for himself, he withdrew it.

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S IMPRESSIONS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>2nd May 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The recent visit of the Emperor Napoleon III. to this
country is a most curious page of history, and gives rise to
many reflections. A remarkable combination of circumstances
has brought about the very intimate alliance which now unites
England and France, for so many centuries the bitterest
enemies and rivals, and this, under the reign of the present
Emperor, the nephew of our greatest foe, and bearing his
name, and brought about by the policy of the late Emperor of
Russia, who considered himself as the head of the European
Alliance against France!</p>

<p class="ind">In reflecting on the character of the present Emperor
Napoleon, and the impression I have conceived of it, the
following thoughts present themselves to my mind:</p>

<p class="ind">That he <i>is</i> a very <i>extraordinary</i> man, with great qualities
there can be <i>no</i> doubt&mdash;I might almost say a mysterious man.
He is evidently possessed of <i>indomitable courage</i>, <i>unflinching
firmness of purpose</i>, <i>self-reliance</i>, <i>perseverance</i>, and <i>great
secrecy</i>; to this should be added, a great reliance on what he
calls his <i>Star</i>, and a belief in omens and incidents as connected
with his future destiny, which is almost romantic&mdash;and at the
same time he is endowed with wonderful <i>self-control</i>, great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.123" id="pageiii.123"></a>[page&nbsp;123]</span>
<i>calmness</i>, even <i>gentleness</i>, and with a <i>power</i> of
<i>fascination</i>, the
effect of which upon all those who become more intimately
acquainted with him is <i>most sensibly</i> felt.</p>

<p class="ind">How far he is actuated by a strong <i>moral</i> sense of <i>right</i> and
<i>wrong</i> is difficult to say. On the one hand, his attempts at
Strasbourg and Boulogne, and this last after having given a
solemn promise never to return or make a similar attempt&mdash;in
which he openly called on the subjects of the then King of
the French to follow him as the successor of Napoleon, the
<i>Coup d'&Eacute;tat</i> of December 1851, followed by great ... severity
and the confiscation of the property of the unfortunate Orleans
family, would lead one to believe that he is not. On the other
hand, his kindness and gratitude towards all those, whether
high or low, who have befriended him or stood by him through
life, and his straightforward and steady conduct towards us
throughout the very difficult and anxious contest in which we
have been engaged for a year and a half, show that he is
possessed of noble and right feelings.</p>

<p class="ind">My impression is, that in all these apparently inexcusable
acts, he has invariably been guided by the belief that he is
<i>fulfilling a destiny</i> which God has <i>imposed</i> upon him, and that,
though cruel or harsh in themselves, they were <i>necessary</i> to
obtain the result which he considered <i>himself</i> as <i>chosen</i> to carry
out, and <i>not</i> acts of <i>wanton</i> cruelty or injustice; for it is
impossible to know him and not to see that there is much
that is truly amiable, kind, and honest in his character.
Another remarkable and important feature in his composition
is, that everything he says or expresses is the <i>result</i> of deep
reflection and of settled purpose, and not merely <i>des phrases
de politesse</i>, consequently when we read words used in his
speech made in the City, we may feel sure that he <i>means</i> what
he says; and therefore I would rely with confidence on his
behaving honestly and faithfully towards us. I am not able
to say whether he is deeply versed in History&mdash;I should rather
think not, as regards it <i>generally</i>, though he may be, and
probably is, well informed in the history of his own country,
certainly fully so in that of the <i>Empire</i>, he having made it his
special study to contemplate and reflect upon all the acts and
designs of his great uncle. He is very well read in German
literature, to which he seems to be very partial. It is said,
and I am inclined to think with truth, that he reads but little,
even as regards despatches from his own foreign Ministers, he
having expressed his surprise at my reading them daily. He
seems to be singularly ignorant in matters not connected
with the branch of his <i>special</i> studies, and to be ill informed
upon them by those who surround him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.124" id="pageiii.124"></a>[page&nbsp;124]</span>
<span class="rightnote">LOUIS PHILIPPE AND NAPOLEON III</span>
<p class="ind">If we compare him with poor King Louis Philippe, I should
say that the latter (Louis Philippe) was possessed of vast knowledge
upon all and every subject, of immense experience in
public affairs, and of great activity of mind; whereas the
Emperor possesses greater judgment and much greater firmness
of purpose, but no experience of public affairs, nor mental
application; he is endowed, as was the late King, with much
fertility of imagination.</p>

<p class="ind">Another great difference between King Louis Philippe and
the Emperor is, that the poor King was <i>thoroughly French</i> in
character, possessing all the liveliness and talkativeness of
that people, whereas the Emperor is as <i>unlike</i> a <i>Frenchman</i> as
possible, being much more <i>German</i> than French in character.... How
could it be expected that the Emperor <i>should</i> have
any <i>experience</i> in <i>public affairs</i>, considering that till six years
ago he lived as a poor exile, for some years even in prison, and
never having taken the slightest part in the <i>public</i> affairs of
<i>any</i> country?</p>

<p class="ind">It is therefore the more astounding, indeed almost incomprehensible,
that he should show all those powers of Government,
and all that wonderful tact in his conduct and manners
which he evinces, and which many a King's son, nurtured in
palaces and educated in the midst of affairs, never succeeds in
attaining. I likewise believe that he would be incapable of
such tricks and over-reachings as practised by poor King
Louis Philippe (for whose memory, as the old and kind friend
of my father, and of whose kindness and amiable qualities
I shall ever retain a lively sense), who in great as well as in
small things took a pleasure in being cleverer and more cunning
than others, often when there was no advantage to be gained
by it, and which was, unfortunately, strikingly displayed in
the transactions connected with the Spanish marriages, which
led to the King's downfall and ruined him in the eyes of all
Europe. On the other hand, I believe that the Emperor
Napoleon would not hesitate to do a thing by main force, even
if in itself unjust and tyrannical, should he consider that the
<i>accomplishment of his destiny</i> demanded it.</p>
<span class="rightnote">ISOLATION OF THE EMPEROR</span>
<p class="ind">The <i>great advantage</i> to be derived for the permanent alliance
of England and France, which is of such vital importance to
both countries, by the Emperor's recent visit, I take to be
this: that, with his peculiar character and views, which are
very personal, a kind, unaffected, and hearty reception by us
<i>personally</i> in our own family will make a lasting impression
upon his mind; he will see that he can rely upon our friendship
and honesty towards him and his country so long as he
remains faithful towards us; naturally frank, he will see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.125" id="pageiii.125"></a>[page&nbsp;125]</span>
advantage to be derived from continuing so; and if he reflects
on the downfall of the former dynasty, he will see that it arose
<i>chiefly</i> from a <i>breach</i> of pledges,... and will be sure, if I be not
very much mistaken in his character, to <i>avoid</i> such a course. It
must likewise not be overlooked that this kindly feeling towards
us, and consequently towards England (the interests of
which are <i>inseparable</i> from us), must be increased when it is
remembered that <i>we</i> are almost the only people in <i>his</i> own
position with whom he has been able to be on any terms of
intimacy, consequently almost the only ones to whom he could
talk easily and unreservedly, which he cannot do naturally
with his inferiors. He and the Empress are in a most isolated
position, unable to trust the only relations who are near them
in France, and surrounded by courtiers and servants, who
from fear or interest do not tell them the truth. It is, therefore,
natural to believe that he will not willingly separate from
those who, like us, do not scruple to put him in possession of
the real facts, and whose conduct is guided by justice and
honesty, and this the more readily as he is supposed to have
always been a searcher after truth. I would go still further,
and think that it is in our power to <i>keep</i> him in the right course,
and to protect him against the extreme flightiness, changeableness,
and to a certain extent want of honesty of his own servants
and nation. We should never lose the opportunity of checking
in the bud any attempt on the part of his agents or ministers to
play us false, frankly informing him of the facts, and encouraging
him to bring forward in an equally frank manner whatever
he has to complain of. This is the course which we have
hitherto pursued, and as he is France in his own sole person,
it becomes of the utmost importance to encourage by every
means in our power that very open intercourse which I must
say has existed between him and Lord Cowley for the last year
and a half, and now, since our personal acquaintance, between
ourselves.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE FRENCH ALLIANCE</span>
<p class="ind">As I said before, the words which fall from his lips are the
result of deep reflection, and part of the deep plan which he
has staked out for himself, and which he intends to carry out.
I would therefore lay stress on the following words which he
pronounced to me immediately after the investiture of the
Order of the Garter: "<i>C'est un lien de plus entre nous, j'ai
pr&ecirc;t&eacute; serment de fid&eacute;lit&eacute; &agrave; votre Majest&eacute; et je le garderai soigneusement.
C'est un grand &eacute;v&eacute;nement pour moi, et j'esp&egrave;re pouvoir
prouver ma reconnaissance envers votre Majest&eacute; et son Pays.</i>"
In a letter said to be written by him to Mr F. Campbell, the
translator of M. Thiers's <i>History of the Consulate and Empire</i>,
when returning the proof-sheets in 1847, he says "Let us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.126" id="pageiii.126"></a>[page&nbsp;126]</span>
hope the day may yet come when I shall carry out the
intentions of my Uncle by uniting the policy and interests of
England and France in an indissoluble alliance. That hope
cheers and encourages me. It forbids my repining at the
altered fortunes of my family."</p>

<p class="ind">If these be truly his words, he certainly has acted up to
them, since he has swayed with an iron hand the destinies of
that most versatile nation, the French. That he should have
written this at a moment when Louis Philippe had succeeded
in all his wishes, and seemed securer than ever in the possession
of his Throne, shows a calm reliance in his destiny and in the
realisation of hopes entertained from his very childhood which
borders on the supernatural.</p>

<p class="ind">These are a few of the many reflections caused by the observation
and acquaintance with the character of this most
extraordinary man, in whose fate not only the interests of this
country, but the whole of Europe are intimately bound up.
I shall be curious to see if, after the lapse of time, my opinion
and estimate of it has been the right one.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>10th May 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns these interesting letters to Lord Clarendon.
When the Emperor expresses a wish that positive instructions
should be sent to Lord Raglan to join in a general
forward movement about to take place, he should be made
aware that Lord Raglan has been ready and most anxious
for the assault taking place on the 26th, and that he only
consented to postpone it for a few days at General Canrobert's
earnest desire, who wished to wait for the army of Reserve.
It should be kept in mind, however, that the English cannot
proceed farther as long as the Mamelon has not been taken,
and that as long as the French refuse to do this they must not
complain of Lord Raglan's not advancing. The refusal to
undertake this has, the Queen is sorry to say, produced a bad
feeling amongst many of our officers and men, which she owns
alarms her.<sup>57</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 57: General Canrobert was deficient in dash and initiative; he knew his defects, and was
relieved of his command at his own request, being succeeded by General P&eacute;lissier.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">On the 24th of May (the Queen's Birthday) a successful expedition was made against
Kertsch, the granary of Sebastopol, and vast quantities of coal, corn, and flour were
either seized by the Allies, or destroyed in anticipation of their seizure by the Russians.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top:-0.5em;">On the 7th of June, the Mamelon (a knoll crowned by a redoubt and protected by the
Rifle Pits) was taken by the French, and the Gravel Pits, an outwork in front of the
Redan, by the English.

<p class="ind">Ernest will have told you what a <i>beautiful</i> and <i>touching</i> sight
and ceremony (the first of the kind ever witnessed in England)
the distribution of the Medals was. From the highest Prince
of the Blood to the lowest Private, all received the same distinction
for the bravest conduct in the severest actions, and
the rough hand of the brave and honest private soldier came
for the first time in contact with that of their Sovereign and
their Queen! Noble fellows! I own I feel as if they were
<i>my own children</i>; my heart beats for <i>them</i> as for my <i>nearest
and dearest</i>. They were so touched, so pleased; many, I hear,
cried&mdash;and they won't hear of giving up their Medals, to have
their names engraved upon them, for fear they should <i>not</i>
receive the <i>identical one</i> put into <i>their hands by me</i>, which is
quite touching. Several came by in a sadly mutilated state.
None created more interest or is more gallant than young Sir
Thomas Troubridge, who had, at Inkerman, <i>one leg</i> and the
<i>other foot</i> carried away by a round shot, and continued commanding
his battery till the battle was won, refusing to be
carried away, only desiring his shattered limbs to be raised
in order to prevent too great a hemorrhage! He was dragged
by in a bath chair, and when I gave him his medal I told him
I should make him one of my Aides-de-camp for his very
gallant conduct, to which he replied: "I am amply repaid
for everything!"<sup>59</sup></p>

her letter. But she does not look upon the question as one of
form. She takes a deep and natural interest in the welfare of
her Indian Empire, and must consider the selection of the fittest
person for the post of Governor-General as of paramount
importance. She had frequently discussed this point with
Lord Palmerston, but the name of Lord Canning never occurred
amongst the candidates alluded to. The Queen is even now
quite ignorant as to the reasons and motives which led to his
selection in preference to those other names, and Mr V. Smith
will see at once that, were the Queen inclined to object to it,
she could not <i>now</i> do so without inflicting a deep, personal
injury on a public man, for whose personal qualities and talents
the Queen has a high regard.</p>

<p class="ind">She accordingly approves the recommendation, but must
repeat her regret that no opportunity had been given to her

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>7th July 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">When the Queen last wrote to General Simpson to express
to him, and through him to her Army in the Crimea, her <i>deep</i>
grief at the loss of their noble, gallant, and excellent Commander,
it was not yet known that Sir George Brown would
return home, and that the command of the Army would
devolve upon General Simpson. She writes to him, therefore,
to-day, for the <i>first</i> time as the Commander-in-Chief of her
heroic Army in the East, to assure him of her confidence and
support. It is as proud a command as any soldier could
desire, but its difficulties and responsibilities are also very
great.</p>

<p class="ind">General Simpson knows well how admirably his lamented
predecessor conducted all the communications with our Allies
the French, and he cannot do better than follow in the same
course. While showing the greatest readiness to act with
perfect cordiality towards them, he will, the Queen trusts, never
allow her Army to be unduly pressed upon, which would only
injure both Armies.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen feels very anxious lest the fearful heat which the
Army is exposed to should increase cholera and fever. Both
the Prince and herself, the Queen can only repeat, have their
minds <i>constantly</i> occupied with the Army, and count the days
and hours between the mails, and it would be a relief to the
Queen to hear herself directly from General Simpson from time
to time when he has leisure to write.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.131" id="pageiii.131"></a>[page&nbsp;131]</span>

Simpson, and joins with the Queen in every possible good
wish for himself and her brave and beloved troops.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S UNPOPULARITY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>12th July 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty....</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston very much regrets to have to say that
the adverse feeling in regard to Lord John Russell grows
stronger and spreads wider every day, and there is a general
desire that he should resign.<sup>62</sup> This desire is expressed by the
great bulk of the steadiest supporters of the Government, and
was conveyed to Lord John this evening in the House of Commons
by Mr Bouverie on behalf of those members of the Government
who are not in the Cabinet. Lord John has himself come
to the same conclusion, and informed Viscount Palmerston this
evening in the House of Commons that he has finally determined
to resign, and will to-morrow or next day write a letter
to that effect to be laid before your Majesty. Viscount Palmerston
told him that however great would be the loss of the
Government by his resignation, yet as this is a question which
more peculiarly regards Lord John personally, his course must
be decided by his own judgment and feelings; but that if he did
not think necessary to resign, Viscount Palmerston would face
Sir Edward Bulwer's Motion with the Government as it is.<sup>63</sup>
He asked Lord John, however, whether, if he determined to
resign, there was any arrangement which he would wish to have
submitted for your Majesty's consideration, and especially
whether, if your Majesty should be graciously pleased to raise
him to the Peerage, such an Honour would be agreeable to him.
He said that perhaps in the autumn such an act of favour on
the part of your Majesty might fall in with his views and would
be gratefully received, but it would not do at present, and
should not be mentioned....</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 62: Lord John Russell had, as stated above, favoured the proposals of Count Buol at
Vienna, compromising the Third Point to the advantage of Russia. The Ministry had
disavowed this view, but Lord John had remained in office. On the 24th of May, Mr
Disraeli moved a vote of censure on the Government for its conduct of the war, fiercely
assailing Lord John for his proceedings both at Vienna and as Minister. In repelling the
charge, Lord John made a vigorous speech disclosing no disposition to modify the British
attitude towards Russian preponderance in the Black Sea, and Mr Disraeli's Motion was
lost by a majority of 100. On a subsequent night he made a further speech strongly
antagonistic to Russia, his attitude as to the Austrian proposals being still undisclosed
to the public. But these speeches caused Count Buol to reveal the favourable view
taken of his proposals by the English and French Plenipotentiaries, and Lord John
Russell's inconsistency aroused widespread indignation.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 63: This Motion was one of censure on Lord John Russell for his conduct at Vienna, and
it was deeply galling to be informed by subordinate members of the Government that,
unless he resigned, they would support the vote of censure. Lord John bowed before the
storm and retired from office.

Palmerston trusts your Majesty will think is expressed in terms
highly honourable to Lord John Russell's feelings as a man and
as a Minister.</p>

<p class="ind">The step, Viscount Palmerston regrets to say, has become
unavoidable. The storm of public opinion, however much it
may exceed any just or reasonable cause, is too overbearing to
be resisted, and Lord John Russell has no doubt best consulted
his own personal interests in yielding to it. After a time there
will be a reaction and justice will be done; but resistance at
present would be ineffectual, and would only increase irritation.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is much concerned by what Lord Palmerston
writes respecting the feeling of the House of Commons. Lord
John's resignation, although a severe loss, may possibly assuage
the storm which he had chiefly produced. But she finds that
Sir E. Lytton's Motion will be equally applicable to the Government
after this event as it would have been before it. She
trusts that no stone will be left unturned to defeat the success
of that Motion, which would plunge the Queen and the executive
Government of the Country into new and most dangerous
complications. These are really not times to play with the
existence of Governments for personal feeling or interests!</p>

<span class="rightnote">AFFAIRS OF SWEDEN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>27th July 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has delayed answering Lord Clarendon's letter
respecting Sweden till she received the first letter from Mr
Magenis,<sup>66</sup> omitted in Lord Clarendon's box. Now, having read
the whole of these documents, she confesses that she requires
some explanation as to the advantages which are to arise to
England from the proposed Treaty, before she can come to any
decision about it. When a Treaty with Sweden was last in
contemplation, she was to have joined in the war against Russia
and to have received a guarantee of the integrity of her dominions
by England and France in return; yet this clause was
found so onerous to this Country, and opening so entirely a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.134" id="pageiii.134"></a>[page&nbsp;134]</span>
field of questions and considerations, that the Cabinet would
not entertain it. Now the same guarantee is to be given by us
without the counterbalancing advantage of Sweden giving us
her assistance in the war.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 66: Mr (afterwards Sir) Arthur Charles Magenis, Minister at Stockholm (and afterwards
at Lisbon), had written to say that an attempt was being made to change the partial
guarantee of Finmark into a general guarantee on behalf of Sweden and Norway. An
important Treaty was concluded between Sweden and Norway, and the Western Powers,
in the following November, which secured the integrity of Sweden and Norway.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">GENERAL SIMPSON'S DIFFICULTIES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>30th July 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Panmure's letter of yesterday
evening, and has signed the dormant Commission for Sir W.
Codrington. A similar course was pursued with regard to Sir
George Cathcart. The Queen hopes that General Simpson
may still rally. He must be in a great state of helplessness at
this moment, knowing that he wants, as everybody out there,
the advantages which Lord Raglan's name, experience, position,
rank, prestige, etc., etc., gave him, having his Military
Secretary ill on board, the head of the Intelligence Department
dead, and no means left him whereby to gather information or
to keep up secret correspondence with the Tartars&mdash;Colonel
Vico<sup>67</sup> dead, who, as Prince Edward told the Queen, had become
a <i>most important</i> element in the good understanding with the
French Army and its new Commander, and not possessing
military rank enough to make the Sardinian General<sup>68</sup> consider
him as his Chief. If all these difficulties are added to those
inherent to the task imposed upon him, one cannot be surprised
at his low tone of hopefulness. As most of these will, however,
meet every Commander whom we now can appoint, the Queen
trusts that means will be devised to assist him as much as
possible in relieving him from too much writing, and in the
diplomatic correspondence he has to carry on. The Queen
repeats her opinion that a <i>Chef de Chancellerie Diplomatique</i>,
such as is customary in the Russian Army, ought to be placed
at his command, and she wishes Lord Panmure to show this
letter to Lords Palmerston and Clarendon, and to consult with
them on the subject. Neither the Chief of the Staff nor the
Military Secretary can supply that want, and the General
himself must feel unequal to it without any experience on the
subject, and so will his successor.</p>

<p class="ind">Prince Edward told the Queen <i>in strict confidence</i> that General
Simpson's position in Lord Raglan's Headquarters had been
anything but pleasant, that the Staff had been barely civil to
him; he was generally treated as an interloper, so that the
Sardinian and French Officers attached to our Headquarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.135" id="pageiii.135"></a>[page&nbsp;135]</span>
observed upon it as a strange thing which would not be tolerated
in their Armies, and that General Simpson showed himself
grateful to them for the civility which they showed to a General
Officer of rank <i>aux cheveux blancs</i>. These little details, considered
together with the General's extreme modesty, enable
one to conceive what his present feelings must be.<sup>69</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 67: Colonel Vico, the French Commissioner attached to Lord Raglan's staff, had died on
the 10th.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 68: General La Marmora.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 69: The Russian resources for the defence of Sebastopol, both as to ammunition and
provisions, were becoming exhausted, and a supreme effort was to be made, by massing
more Russian troops in the Crimea, to inflict a decisive blow on the besieging forces of
the Allies. Early on the morning of the 16th of August Prince Gortschakoff attacked the
French and Piedmontese at the River Tchernaya. The attack on the left was repulsed
by the French with the utmost spirit and with very little loss; while the Russian loss,
both in killed and wounded, was severe. The Sardinian army, under General La Marmora,
were no less successful on the right. The news of this victory did not reach England
until the Queen and Prince had left for their visit to Paris.

into Paris was a scene which was <i>quite feenhaft</i>, and which
could hardly be seen anywhere else; was quite <i>overpowering</i>&mdash;splendidly
decorated&mdash;illuminated&mdash;immensely crowded&mdash;and
60,000 troops out&mdash;from the Gare de Strasbourg to St Cloud,
of which 20,000 Gardes Nationales, who had come great
distances to see me.</p>

<p class="ind">The Emperor has done wonders for Paris, and for the Bois
de Boulogne. Everything is beautifully <i>mont&eacute;</i> at Court&mdash;<i>very</i>
quiet, and in excellent order; I must say we are both much
struck with the difference between this and the poor King's
time, when the noise, confusion, and bustle were great. We
have been to the Exposition, to Versailles&mdash;which is most
splendid and magnificent&mdash;to the Grand Op&eacute;ra, where the
reception and the way in which "God save the Queen" was
sung were <i>most magnificent</i>. Yesterday we went to the
Tuileries; in the evening <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre ici</i>; to-night an immense

the Cent Gardes are splendid too.</p>

and that we had greatly admired the King's great works at

(as in everything) has shown <i>great</i> tact and good feeling
about all this, and spoke without any bitterness of the King.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>29th August 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;Here we are again, after the <i>pleasantest</i>
and <i>most interesting</i> and triumphant ten days that I think
I ever passed. So complete a success, so very hearty and kind
a reception with and from so <i>difficile</i> a people as the French
is indeed <i>most</i> gratifying and <i>most</i> promising for the future.
The Army were most friendly and amicable towards us also.</p>

<p class="ind">In short, the <i>complete</i> Union of the two countries is stamped
and sealed in the most satisfactory and solid manner, for it is
not <i>only</i> a Union of the two Governments&mdash;the two Sovereigns&mdash;it
is that of the <i>two Nations!</i> Albert has told you of all
the very extraordinary combinations of circumstances which
helped to make all so interesting, so satisfactory. Of the
splendour of the <i>F&ecirc;te</i> at Versailles I can really give <i>no</i> faint
impression, for it exceeded all imagination! I have formed
a <i>great</i> affection for the Emperor, and I believe it is very
reciprocal, for he showed us a confidence which we must feel as
very gratifying, and spoke to us on all subjects, even the <i>most
delicate</i>. I find <i>no</i> great personal rancour towards the Orleans.
He has destroyed nothing that the King did, even to the
Gymnastics of the children at St Cloud, and showed much
kind and good feeling in taking us to see poor Chartres' monument,
which is beautiful. Nothing could exceed his tact and
kindness. I find I must end in a great hurry, and will say
more another day. Ever your devoted Niece,</p>

<p class="ind">You continue to refuse to answer me, but I am <i>not</i> discouraged
by it; but on the contrary <i>must</i> write to you to give
<i>vent</i> to my <i>delight</i> at our triumphant, most interesting, and
most enjoyable visit to Paris! The Prince has written to you,
and given you some general accounts, which will please you,
and the <i>Times</i> has some descriptions ... of the wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.139" id="pageiii.139"></a>[page&nbsp;139]</span>
beauty and magnificence of <i>every</i>thing. I never enjoyed
myself more, or was more delighted or more interested, <i>and I
can think</i> and talk of nothing else. I am <i>deeply</i> touched by the
extraordinary warmth, heartiness, and enthusiasm with which
we have been received by <i>all</i> ranks, and the kindness shown
to every one has brought us all back&mdash;beginning with ourselves
and ending with the lowest of our servants&mdash;full of
gratitude, pleasure, admiration, regret at its being over, and a
great desire to see such a visit renewed! It was touching and
pleasing in the extreme to see the alliance sealed so completely,
and without lowering <i>either</i> Country's pride, and to see
old enmities and rivalries <i>wiped out</i> over the tomb of Napoleon
I., before whose coffin I stood (by torchlight) at the arm of
Napoleon III., now my nearest and dearest ally! We have
come back with feelings of <i>real</i> affection for and interest in
<i>France</i>&mdash;and indeed how could it be otherwise when one saw
<i>how</i> much was done to <i>please</i> and delight us? The Army too
(such a fine one!) I feel a real affection for, as the companions
of my beloved troops!</p>

<p class="ind">For the Emperor <i>personally</i> I have conceived a <i>real</i> affection
and friendship, and so I may truly say of the Prince.
You know what <i>I felt</i> the moment I saw him and became
acquainted with him, what I wrote down about him, etc.
Well, we have now seen him for full <i>ten days</i>, from twelve to
fourteen hours every day&mdash;often alone; and I cannot say
<i>how</i> pleasant and easy it is to live with him, or how attached
one becomes to him. I know <i>no</i> one who puts me more at my
ease, or to whom I felt more inclined to talk unreservedly, or in
whom involuntarily I should be more inclined to confide, than
the Emperor! He was entirely at his ease with us&mdash;spoke
most openly and frankly with us on all subjects&mdash;<span class="sc">EVEN</span> the
<i>most</i> delicate, viz. the Orleans Family (this was with <i>me</i>, for I
was driving alone with him), and I am happy to <i>feel</i> that there
is nothing now between us which could <i>mar</i> our personal good
<i>entente</i> and friendly and intimate footing. He is so simple, so
<i>na&iuml;f</i>, never making <i>des phrases</i>, or paying compliments&mdash;so full
of tact, good taste, high breeding; his attentions and respect
towards us were so simple and unaffected, his kindness and
friendship for the Prince so natural and so gratifying, <i>because</i>
it is <i>not</i> forced, not <i>pour faire des compliments</i>. He is quite
<i>The Emperor</i>, and yet in <i>no</i> way playing it; the Court and
whole house infinitely more <i>regal</i> and better managed than in
poor Louis Philippe's time, when all was in great noise and
confusion, and there was <i>no</i> Court. We parted with <i>mutual</i>
sorrow, and the Emperor expressed his hope that we shall
frequently meet and "pas avec de si grandes c&eacute;r&eacute;monies"!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.140" id="pageiii.140"></a>[page&nbsp;140]</span>

<p class="ind">What I write here is my feeling and conviction: wonderful it is
that this <i>man</i>&mdash;whom certainly we were <i>not</i> over well-disposed
to&mdash;should by <i>force</i> of <i>circumstances</i> be drawn into such close
connection with us, and become <i>personally</i> our friend, and <i>this</i>
entirely by his <i>own personal</i> qualities, in spite of so much that
<i>was and could</i> be said against him! To the children (who
behaved beautifully, and had the most extraordinary success)
his kindness, and judicious kindness, was <i>great</i>, and they are
<i>excessively</i> fond of him. In short, without <i>attempting</i> to do
anything particular to <i>make</i> one like him, or <span class="sc">ANY</span> personal
attraction in outward appearance, he <i>has</i> the power of <i>attaching</i>
those to him who come near him and know him, which is
<i>quite incredible</i>. He is excessively kind in private, and so very
quiet. I shall always look back on the time passed not only
in France, but with <i>him</i> personally, as <i>most</i> agreeable. The
Prince, though less enthusiastic than I am, I can see well,
shares this feeling, and I think it is very reciprocal on the
Emperor's part; he is very fond of the Prince and truly appreciates
him. With respect to the War, nothing can be more
frank and fair and honest than he is about it, but it makes him
unhappy and anxious.</p>

<span class="rightnote">MISGOVERNMENT AT NAPLES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>3rd September 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has read the enclosed papers, and must express
her strongest objection to a Naval Demonstration (which to
be effectual must be prepared to pass on to measures of
hostility), in order to obtain changes in the <i>internal system of
Government</i> of the Kingdom of Naples.<sup>75</sup> England would thereby
undertake a responsibility which she is in no way capable of
bearing, unless she took the Government permanently into
her own hands. The plea on which the interference is to be
based, viz. that the misgovernment at Naples brings Monarchical
institutions into disrepute, and might place weapons in
the hands of the democracy (as put forth by Sir W. Temple),<sup>76</sup>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.141" id="pageiii.141"></a>[page&nbsp;141]</span>
would be wholly <i>insufficient</i> to justify the proceeding. Whether
such an armed interference in favour of the people of Naples
against their Government would lead to a Revolution or not,
as apprehended by the French Government and disbelieved by
Lord Palmerston, must be so entirely a matter of chance that
it would be idle to predict the exact consequences. If 99 out
of every 100 Neapolitans, however, are dissatisfied with their
Government (as Lord Palmerston states), it is not unreasonable
to expect that our demonstration may give them confidence
enough to rise, and if beat down by the King's troops
in presence of our ships, our position would become exceedingly
humiliating.</p>

<p class="ind">Any insult offered to the British Government, on the other
hand, it has a perfect right to resent, and to ask reparation for.
The case, however, is a very unpleasant one. The Neapolitan
Government deny having intended any slight on the British
Legation by the order respecting the Box of the "Intendant
du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre," which they state to have been general, and deny
any intention to interfere with the free intercourse of the
members of our Legation with Neapolitans, to which Sir W.
Temple merely replies that notwithstanding the denial such
an intention is believed by the public to exist.</p>

<p class="ind">The case becomes therefore a very delicate one, requiring
the greatest care on our part not to put ourselves in the wrong.</p>
<span class="rightnote">CO-OPERATION OF THE POWERS</span>
<p class="ind">It will be of the greatest importance to come to a thorough
understanding with France, and if possible also with Austria,
on the subject.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 75: Lord Palmerston had suggested co-operation by England and France in obtaining
the dismissal of the Neapolitan Minister of Police as an <i>amende</i> for an affront offered to this
country, to be enforced by a naval demonstration, coupled with a demand for the liberation
of political prisoners.</p>

<span class="rightnote">ATTITUDE OF AUSTRIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Balmoral</span>, <i>14th September 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Clarendon</span>,&mdash;I was sent for after breakfast. The
Queen and the Prince are much pleased with the draft of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.144" id="pageiii.144"></a>[page&nbsp;144]</span>
Despatch to Naples; they think it good and dignified. With
respect to the draft to Lord Stratford, instructing him to recommend
to the Porte an application to the Austrian Government
for the withdrawal or diminution of the Austrian troops
in the Principalities, I have been commanded to write what
the Queen has not time this morning to put on paper. Her
Majesty does not feel that the objects of this proposed Despatch
have been sufficiently explained. It does not appear
to Her Majesty that, in a military point of view, the plans of
the Allies are sufficiently matured to make it clear whether
the withdrawal of the Austrian Army would be an advantage
or a disadvantage. If the Allies intend to march through
the Principalities, and attack Russia on that side, the presence
of the Austrians might be an inconvenience. If, on the other
hand, they advance from the East, it is a positive advantage
to have the Russians contained on the other flank, by the
Austrians in their present position. Looking at the political
bearing of this move, Her Majesty thinks that it will not fail
to have an unfavourable effect on Austria, who will be hurt at
the Allies urging the Porte to endeavour to put an end to an
arrangement entered into at the suggestion, or at all events
with the approval, of the Allies. It cannot be an object at this
moment, when extraneous circumstances have probably acted
favourably for us on the minds of the Emperor of Austria and
his Government, to check that disposition, make them distrust
us, and incline them to throw themselves towards Russia, who
now will spare no efforts to gain them. Her Majesty sees by
your proposed Despatch you do not expect the Austrians
to comply with this demand. Even if they consented to
diminish the numbers of their Troops, they would do so only
to suit their own convenience, and such diminution would in
no ways decrease the evils of the occupation. Lastly, the
Queen is of opinion that if such a proposal is to be made,
it ought not to be done through Lord Stratford and the
Porte, but that the subject should be broached at Vienna
and the Austrian Government asked what their intentions
are; that this would be the more friendly, more open, and
more dignified course, and more likely than the other plan
of being successful. Her Majesty, however, doubts that any
such demand will be acceded to by the Austrians, and
believes that their refusal will put the Allies in an awkward
position.</p>

<p class="ind">This is, I believe, the pith of Her Majesty's opinions&mdash;there
appears to me to be much sense in them&mdash;and they are well
deserving of your and Palmerston's consideration. Yours
sincerely,</p>

<span class="rightnote">LIFE PEERAGES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Balmoral</span>, <i>19th September 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has to thank Lord Palmerston for his letter of
the 16th. The want of Law Lords in the Upper House has
often been complained of, and the Queen has long been of
opinion that in order to remedy the same without adding
permanently to the Peerage, the Crown ought to use its
prerogative in creating Peers for life only. Lord Lansdowne
coincided with this view, and Lord John Russell actually proposed
a "Life Peerage" to Dr. Lushington, who declined it,
however, from a dislike to become the first of the kind. Mr
Pemberton Leigh has <i>twice</i> declined a Peerage, but the Queen
can have no objection to its being offered to him again.<sup>81</sup>...</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your

<p class="ind">A Blue Ribbon has become vacant by the death of the late
Duke of Somerset, and Viscount Palmerston having communicated
with Lord Lansdowne and Lord Clarendon on the
subject, would beg to submit for your Majesty's gracious
consideration that this honour might be well conferred upon
the Duke of Newcastle, who has been the object of much
undeserved attack, though certainly from inexperience not
altogether exempt from criticism, and who since his retirement
from office has shaped his public course in a manner honourable
to himself, and advantageously contrasting with the aberrations
of some of his former colleagues.<sup>82</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty must no doubt have been struck with the vast
accumulation of warlike stores found at Sebastopol. That
there should have remained there four thousand cannon, after
the wear and tear of the Siege, proves the great importance
attached by the Russian Government to that Arsenal over
which your Majesty's Flag is now triumphantly flying.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is anxious to mark her sense of the services of
the Army and Military Departments at home by conferring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.146" id="pageiii.146"></a>[page&nbsp;146]</span>
the rank of Field-Marshal on Lord Hardinge, who, from his
position as Commander-in-Chief, and his long, distinguished
services, has a strong claim to such an honour. Moreover,
Marshal Vaillant receiving the G.C.B., whilst it has been thought
more prudent not to accept the <i>L&eacute;gion d'Honneur</i> for Lord
Hardinge, makes it the more desirable. The Prince is now
again the only Field-Marshal in the Army, which has always
had several. The Queen thinks that Lord Combermere, being
the second senior officer of the whole Army, a full General of
1825, might expect not to be passed over when Lord Hardinge
is made. The only other General of distinction and seniority
might be Lord Strafford, but he is only a full General of 1841.
On this point Lord Palmerston might consult Lord Hardinge
himself. If he and Lord Combermere alone are made, the
honour is the greater for him.<sup>83</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thinks likewise that Lord Panmure ought to
receive a mark of favour and approval of his conduct on the
occasion of the Fall of Sebastopol; either the Civil G.C.B.
or a step in the Peerage&mdash;that of Viscount.<sup>84</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Palmerston would perhaps, without delay, give his
opinion on these subjects to the Queen; the honours she would
wish then <i>personally</i> to bestow upon the recipients, and she
thinks the arrival of the official Despatches the right moment
for doing so.</p>

to your Majesty his most sincere congratulations upon the
prospective arrangement which His Royal Highness the Prince
Albert announced in his letter to Lord Clarendon, but which,
for obvious reasons, should be left to public conjecture for the

Greek at the University of Oxford, which was held by the late

having doubts as to the best person to be appointed. The
present Dean of Christchurch admitted that the Professorship
ought to be separated from the Deanery; he has now recommended
for the Professorship the Rev. B. Jowett, Fellow and
Tutor of Balliol College, who is an eminent Greek scholar and
won the Hertford Scholarship; and Viscount Palmerston

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>31st October 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that he has this morning seen Lord
Stanley, and offered to him the post of Secretary of State
for the Colonies.<sup>87</sup> Lord Stanley expressed himself as highly
gratified personally by an offer which he said he was wholly
unprepared to receive, and which was above his expectations
and pretensions; but he said that as he owed to his father
Lord Derby whatever position he may have gained in public
life, he could not give an answer without first consulting Lord
Derby. Viscount Palmerston said that of course in making
the proposal, he had taken for granted that Lord Stanley would
consult Lord Derby first, because a son would not take a
decision on such a subject without consulting his father, even
if that father were merely in private life; and next because
such a course would be still more natural in this case, considering
Lord Derby's political position with reference to those with
whom Lord Stanley has more or less been generally acting.
Lord Stanley said that he should go down to Knowsley by the
five o'clock train this afternoon, and that he would at an early
moment communicate his answer to Viscount Palmerston;
but he said that if he was to state now his anticipation of what
Lord Derby would recommend and wish him to do, it would
rather be to decline the offer.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 87: Sir William Molesworth, who had represented Radicalism in the Cabinets of Lord
Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston, died on the 22nd, at the age of forty-five. The Premier
thereupon offered the vacant place to Lord Stanley, one of his political opponents, then
only twenty-eight, who was the son of the leader of the Conservative Opposition, and had
already held office under his father. Lord Stanley's temperament was, in fact, more
inclined to Liberalism than that of Lord Palmerston himself, and, twenty-seven years
later, he took the office in a Liberal Government which he now declined.

<span class="rightnote">MR SIDNEY HERBERT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>10th November 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that in consequence of some things
that passed in conversation at Sir Charles Wood's two days
ago, when Mr and Mrs Sidney Herbert dined there, Sir Charles
Wood is under a strong impression that Mr Herbert would
be willing to separate himself from Mr Gladstone and Sir
James Graham, and the Peace Party, and to join the present
Government. Viscount Palmerston having well considered
the matter in concert with Sir Charles Wood and Sir George
Grey, is of opinion that it would be advantageous not only for
the present, but also with a view to the future, to detach Mr
Herbert from the clique with which accidental circumstances
have for the moment apparently associated him, and to fix him
to better principles of action than those by which Mr Gladstone
and Sir James Graham appear to be guided. For this
purpose Viscount Palmerston proposes with your Majesty's
sanction to offer to Mr Herbert to return to the Colonial Office,
which he held on the formation of the present Government.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Herbert is the most promising man of his standing in the
House of Commons, and is personally very popular in that
House; he is a good and an improving speaker, and his
accession to the Government would add a good speaker to the
Treasury Bench, and take away a good speaker from ranks
that may become hostile.</p>

<p class="ind">He would also supply the place of Lord Canning as a kind
of link between the Government and some well-disposed
members of both Houses who belonged more or less to what
is called the Peel Party. It would be necessary, of course, to
ascertain clearly that Mr Herbert's views about the war and
about conditions of peace are the same as they were when he
was a Member of the Government, and not such as those which
Mr Gladstone and Sir James Graham have of late adopted.</p>

<p class="ind">If Mr Herbert were to accept, Sir George Grey, who has a
strong disinclination for the Colonies, would remain at the
Home Office; and if Lord Harrowby would take the Post
Office, which must be held by a Peer, the Duchy of Lancaster,
which may be held by a Commoner, might be offered to Mr
Baines<sup>88</sup> with a seat in the Cabinet, and Mr Baines might perhaps,
with reference to his health, prefer an office not attended with
much departmental business of detail, while he would be thus
more free to make himself master of general questions. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.150" id="pageiii.150"></a>[page&nbsp;150]</span>
an arrangement would leave the Cabinet, as stated in the
accompanying paper, seven and seven; and if afterwards
Lord Stanley of Alderley were added in the Lords, and Sir
Benjamin Hall in the Commons, which, however, would be
a matter entirely for future consideration, the equality of
division would still be preserved.<sup>89</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston finds that Mr Herbert is gone down
to Wilton, and as Viscount Palmerston is going this afternoon
to Broadlands to remain there till Tuesday morning, he proposes
during the interval to communicate with Mr Herbert,
Wilton being not much more than an hour's distance from
Broadlands by the Salisbury railway.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 88: Mr. Matthew Talbot Baines died prematurely in 1860. His abilities were of a solid
rather than a brilliant kind.

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that he has seen Mr Sidney Herbert,
who declines joining the Government, because he thinks that
his doing so would expose both him and the Government to
the suspicion of having altered their opinions. The difference
between him and the Government is not as to the necessity of
prosecuting the war with vigour, but as to the conditions of
peace with which he would be satisfied. He would consent to
accept conditions which he is aware that the country would
not approve, and to which he does not expect that the Government
would agree. Viscount Palmerston will have to consider
with his Colleagues on Tuesday what arrangement it
will be best for him to submit for the sanction of your Majesty.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>13th November 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the enclosed most important letters.
She has read them with much interest, but not without a very
anxious feeling that great changes are taking place in the whole
position of the Eastern Question and the War, without our
having the power to direct them or even a complete knowledge
of them.<sup>90</sup> Should Austria really be sincere,&mdash;if the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.151" id="pageiii.151"></a>[page&nbsp;151]</span>
Napoleon is really determined not to carry on the war on a large
scale without her joining, we shall be obliged by common
prudence to follow him in his negotiations. He may mistrust
our secrecy and diplomacy, and wish to obtain by his personal
exertions a continental league against Russia. The missions
to Stockholm and Copenhagen, the language to Baron Beust
and M. von der Pfordten and M. de Bourqueney's single-handed
negotiation, seem to point to this. Can Russia have
secretly declared her readiness to accept the "Neutralisation"?
It is hardly possible, and if so it would be a concession we cannot
refuse to close upon. Whatever may be the case, the Queen
thinks it the wisest course not to disturb the Emperor's
plans, or to show suspicion of them, but merely to insist
upon the importance of the Army in the Crimea being kept
so imposing that Russia cannot safely arrange her plans
on the supposition of a change of policy on the part of
the Western Powers.</p>

<p class="ind">Had the Queen known of Lord Cowley's letter a few hours
earlier, she could have spoken to the Duke of Cambridge, who
was here; as it was, both she and the Prince were very cautious
and reserved in what they told him.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thought it right to let Sir Hamilton Seymour,
who is staying here, see the letters, as his thorough acquaintance
with the present position of affairs is most important.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 90: The Emperor was now bent on the termination of hostilities, and the French and
Austrian Governments had concerted proposals for peace to be submitted to Russia,
with which they somewhat peremptorily demanded that England should concur. Lord
Palmerston announced that, rather than make an unsatisfactory peace, he would continue
the war without the aid of France. States such as Saxony and Bavaria favoured Russia,
and Baron Beust and M. von der Pfordten, their respective Prime Ministers, had interviews
with the Emperor, who was anxious for peace on the basis of the Third Point, on which,
since the fall of Sebastopol, the Allies were in a better position to insist.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Sir Charles Wood.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>16th November 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes to draw Sir Charles Wood's attention to a
subject which may become of much importance for the future.
It is the absence of any Dockyard for building and repairing
out of the Channel, with the exception of Pembroke. Should
we ever be threatened by a combination of Russia and France,
the absence of a Government establishment in the north would
be very serious. It strikes the Queen that the present moment,
when our yards hardly supply the demands made upon them,
and when attention is directed to the Baltic, is a particularly
favourable one to add an establishment in the Firth of Forth,
for which the Queen believes the Government possess the ground
at Leith. Such a measure would at the same time be very
popular in Scotland, and by making the Queen's Navy known
there, which it hardly is at present, would open a new field for
recruiting our Marine.</p>

<p class="ind">Whether Cork in Ireland should not also be made more
available is very well worth consideration.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.152" id="pageiii.152"></a>[page&nbsp;152]</span>

<span class="rightnote">THE AUSTRIAN ULTIMATUM</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>19th November 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has attentively perused the voluminous papers,
which she now returns according to Lord Clarendon's wish.</p>

<p class="ind">An anxious consideration of their contents has convinced
her that it would be the height of impolicy if we were not to
enter fairly and unreservedly into the French proposal, and she
wishes Lord Clarendon to express this her opinion to the
Cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind">The terms of the Austrian Ultimatum are clear and complete
and very favourable to us, if accepted by Russia.<sup>91</sup> If refused,
which they almost must be, rupture of diplomatic relations
between Austria and Russia is a decided step gained by us,
and will produce a state of things which can scarcely fail to
lead them to war.</p>

<p class="ind">A refusal to entertain the proposal may induce and perhaps
justify the Emperor of the French in backing out of the War,
which would leave us in a miserable position.</p>

<p class="ind">If we are to agree to the Emperor's wishes, it must be politic
not to risk the advantage of the whole measure by a discussion
with Austria upon minor points of detail, which will cost time,
and may lead to differences.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 91: The Queen and her Ministers, however, insisted that the neutralisation clause (the
Third Point) should be made effective, not left illusory, and incorporated in the principal
and not in a supplementary treaty. Modified in this and other particulars, an ultimatum
embodying the Austrian proposals, which stipulated, <i>inter alia</i>, for the cession of a portion
of Bessarabia, was despatched to St Petersburg on the 15th of December, and the 18th
of January was fixed as the last day on which a reply would be accepted.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Viscount Hardinge.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>22nd November 1855</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen informs Lord Hardinge that on speaking to Sir
Colin Campbell yesterday, and informing him how much she
wished that his valuable services should not be lost to her
Army in the Crimea, he replied in the handsomest manner, that
he would return immediately&mdash;"for that, if the Queen wished
it, he was ready to serve under a Corporal"! Conduct like
this is very gratifying, and will only add to Sir Colin Campbell's
high name; but, as by Lord Hardinge's and Lord Panmure's
advice, the Queen has obtained from him this <i>sacrifice</i> of <i>his own</i>
feelings to <i>her</i> wishes, <i>she</i> feels personally bound <i>not</i> to
<i>permit</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.153" id="pageiii.153"></a>[page&nbsp;153]</span>
him to be passed over a <i>second</i> time should the Command again
become vacant.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has had a good deal of conversation with him,
and from what he told her, as well as from what she has heard
from others, there seems to be a good deal of laxity of discipline&mdash;particularly
as regards the officers&mdash;in the Army in the Crimea;
and she thinks Lord Hardinge should give an order to prevent
so many officers coming home on leave except when <i>really ill</i>.
The effect of this on the French is very bad, and the Prince had
a letter only two days ago from the Prince of Prussia, saying
that every one was shocked at the manner in which our officers
came home, and that it lowered our Army very much in the
eyes of foreign Armies, and generally decreased the sympathy
for our troops. We deeply regret the death of poor General
Markham.<sup>92</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 92: He commanded the 2nd Division of the Army at the attack on the Redan, and after
the fall of Sebastopol, his health, already shattered, broke down completely; he returned

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter, and returns
the very satisfactory enclosures from Lord Cowley. Count
Walewski remains true to himself; yet the admission that the
Neutralisation Clause ought to be part of the European treaty,
and not an annex, which <i>he makes</i>, is the most important concession
which we could desire. That the Sea of Azov is to be
dropped the Queen is glad of, as it would appear so humiliating
to Russia that Austria would probably decline proposing it.
What the Queen is most afraid of, and what she believes
actuates the Emperor also, is the consideration that Austria,
made aware of the intense feeling for Peace <i>&agrave; tout prix</i> in France,
might get frightened at the good terms for us she meant to
propose to Russia, and might long for an opportunity given by
us, in any unreasonable demand for modification, to back out
of her proposal altogether. Lord A. Loftus in his last letter
states that Baron Manteuffel<sup>93</sup> even was afraid of having
admitted as proper, terms too hard upon Russia, since peace
is wanted at Paris.</p>

<p class="ind">The course intended to be pursued by Lord Clarendon in
summing up the whole question in a public Despatch seems
quite the right one, as it would never do, on the other hand,
to let England be considered as merely <i>&agrave; la remorque</i> of France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.154" id="pageiii.154"></a>[page&nbsp;154]</span>
an impression unfortunately very prevalent on the Continent
at this moment.<sup>94</sup></p>

<p class="ind">As to Marshal P&eacute;lissier, the best thing the Emperor could do
would be to recall him, and to put a younger and more enterprising
man in his place. As we have got our hero coming
home, his French colleague might be recalled also.</p>

<p class="ind">The Duke of Newcastle's letter is very interesting; the Queen
will return it this evening. It confirms the truth of the axiom
that a <i>settled policy</i> ought to precede a military plan of campaign,
for which the Prince is always contending.</p>

<p class="ind">We have been much pleased with old Sir Colin Campbell,
who is a thorough soldier, and appears not at all wanting in
good sense. On asking him about our rising men, and the officer
whom <i>he</i> would point out as the one of most promise, he said
that Colonel Mansfield<sup>95</sup> was without comparison the man
from whom great services could be expected both in the Field
and as an Administrator. Lord Clarendon will be pleased to
hear this, but will also not be surprised if the Queen should
look out for an opportunity to reclaim him for the Army
from the Foreign Office.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 93: President of the Prussian Ministry.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 94: Lord Clarendon, in the letter to which this was a reply, observed that he had asked

<p class="ind">The Queen returns Lord Cowley's letter and General P&eacute;lissier's
telegram. Lord Cowley is quite right in insisting upon
a clear understanding between England and France before
negotiations are entered into with Austria. To come to a
speedy agreement, it will be wise to drop the minor points and
<i>insist</i> upon the most important. These the Queen takes to be
the incorporation of the <i>Neutralisation</i> Clause in the general
Treaty, and the promise on the part of Austria not to accept and
communicate to us counter-proposals from Russia. If France
agreed to this, we might agree to the rest of the arrangement.
General P&eacute;lissier's plan has the advantage of setting us free, but
deprives us of the Sardinians in the field, an object the French
have kept steadily in view. The Duke of Cambridge will
come down here to-night, and we may then hear more on

his appointment to the Command of the Queen's gallant
Army in the East, having arrived, she will no longer delay
writing herself to Sir William, to assure him of her support and
confidence in his new, proud, and important, though at the
same time difficult position. She wishes to assure him of her
confidence and support. It is with pleasure that she sees the
son of her old friend and devoted servant, himself so distinguished
in the sister Service, raised by his own merits to so
exalted a position. Sir William knows the Queen's pride in
her beloved Troops, as well as her unceasing solicitude for their
welfare and glory, and she trusts he will on all occasions express
these feelings from herself personally.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen feels certain that Sir William Codrington will
learn, with great satisfaction, that that distinguished and gallant
officer, Sir Colin Campbell, has most readily and handsomely
complied with the Queen's wishes that he should return to the
Crimea and take command of the First Corps d'Arm&eacute;e. His
presence and his assistance will be of essential service to Sir
William Codrington, who, the Queen knows, entertains so high
an opinion of him.</p>

<p class="ind">The Prince wishes his sincere congratulations and kind
remembrance to be conveyed to Sir William Codrington.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen would be glad if Sir William could&mdash;when he has

who had resigned a task which he found overtaxed his powers. Sir William Codrington
was junior to three other Generals, who might have felt aggrieved by being passed over.
The sagacity of the Prince found a way out of the difficulty by appointing two of the three
to the commands of the two <i>corps d'arm&eacute;e</i> into which the Army had, at his instance, been
subdivided. See <i>ante.</i> <a href="#pageiii.153" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 153</a>.

much sound good sense. He never breaks his word, and you
may rely on him, but wild and extravagant, courting adventures
and dangers, and with a very strange, short, rough manner,
an exaggeration of that short manner of speaking which his
poor brother had. He is shy in society, which makes him still
more brusque, and he does not know (never having been out of
his own country or even out in Society) what to say to the
number of people who are presented to him here, and which is,
I know from experience, a most odious thing. He is truly
attached to the Orleans family, particularly to Aumale, and
will be a friend and adviser to them. To-day he will be invested
with the Order of the Garter. He is more like a Knight
or King of the Middle Ages than anything one knows nowadays.</p>

<p class="ind">One word about Vicky. I must say that she has a quick
discernment of character, and I have never seen her take <i>any</i>
predilection for a person which was <i>not motiv&eacute;</i> by personal
amiability, goodness, or distinction of some kind or other.
You need be under no apprehension whatever on this subject;
and she has, moreover, great tact and <i>esprit de conduite</i>. It is
quite extraordinary how popular she is in Society&mdash;and again
now, all these Foreigners are so struck with her sense and
<i>conversation</i> for her age.</p>

Palmerston on his return from Woburn, where he was for two
days, saw the Duke of Newcastle, but found that the enclosed
letter expressed the intention which he had formed. Viscount
Palmerston would propose to your Majesty the Earl of Fortescue
as a deserving object of your Majesty's gracious favour;
Lord Fortescue held the high office of Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland, and is a person highly and universally respected.<sup>98</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston cannot refrain from saying on this
occasion that he is not without a misgiving that the high
amount of fees which he understands is paid by persons who
are made Knights of the Garter may have some effect in rendering
those whose incomes are not very large less anxious than
they would otherwise be to receive this distinction; and he
cannot but think that it is unseemly in general that persons
upon whom your Majesty may be disposed to confer dignities
and honours, either as a mark of your Majesty's favour or as a
reward for their public services, should on that account be
subject to a heavy pecuniary fine; and he intends to collect
information with a view to consider whether all such fees might
not be abolished, the officers to whom they are now paid receiving
compensation in the shape of adequate fixed salary.<sup>99</sup> ...</p>

She would <i>most strongly</i> urge Lord Panmure to give at once

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<p>After two years' duration, the Crimean War was terminated in
March 1856, at a Conference of the Powers assembled at Paris, by
a treaty the principal terms of which provided for the integrity of
Turkey, and her due participation in the public law and system of
Europe, the neutralisation of the Black Sea, and the opening of its
waters to commerce (with the interdiction, except in a limited degree,
of the flag of war of any nation, and of the erection by either Russia
or Turkey of arsenals), free navigation of the Danube, cession of a
portion of Bessarabia by Russia, and the reciprocal evacuation of
invaded territories; the Principalities to be continued in their existing
privileges under the suzerainty of the Porte and a guarantee of
the Contracting Powers. No European protectorate was to be established
over the Sultan's Christian subjects. Certain general principles
of International Law were also agreed upon. In the course of
the summer, the Guards made a public re-entry into London; and
the Crimea was finally evacuated; great reviews of the returned
troops taking place at Aldershot. The thanks of Parliament were
accorded to the soldiers and sailors engaged, and peace-rejoicings
celebrated on a great scale.</p>

<p>The Commissioners who had been sent out, nearly a year before,
to the Crimea, to investigate the causes of the breakdown in various
military departments, presented a Report, censuring several high
officials; a Military Commission was accordingly appointed to investigate
the Report, and after sitting for some months at Chelsea,
completely exonerated the officials in question.</p>

<p>The Government having resolved to strengthen the administration
of the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords, Letters Patent
were made out purporting to create Sir James Parke, an ex-Judge,
a Baron for his life, under the title of Lord Wensleydale. After
frequent and protracted debates on this question, the Peers decided
that such a patent conferred no right to sit and vote in Parliament.
The Government gave up the contest by creating Sir James (who had
no son) a hereditary peer.</p>

<p>The Czar Alexander was crowned at Moscow in September with
great ceremonial, the Sultan being duly represented, while Lord
Granville was present as special Ambassador for the Queen. The
discovery of the cruelty with which political offenders were being
treated in Neapolitan prisons led to the rupture of diplomatic relations
between England in union with France on the one hand, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.159" id="pageiii.159"></a>[page&nbsp;159]</span>
King Ferdinand on the other; while a dispute as to the enlistment
of recruits for the English Army in the United States led to the
dismissal of the British Minister at Washington, and to temporary
friction between the two countries.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Treaty of Paris were not carried out without
considerable procrastination on the part of Russia, which, by its
method of evacuating Kars and surrendering Ismail and Reni, and
by laying claim to Serpent's Island at the mouth of the Danube,
compelled England to send a fleet to the Black Sea, to enforce strict
observance of the Treaty. By the end of the year the matter was
arranged, though in the meantime the possibility of Great Britain
being represented at the Czar's coronation had been imperilled.</p>

<p>The abuses which had long existed in the Government of Oudh
induced the Governor-General of India, early in the year, to issue
a proclamation placing that kingdom permanently under the authority
of the British Crown. Lord Dalhousie at this time retired
from the office (which he had held for eight years) of Governor-General,
and was succeeded by Lord Canning. It fell to the lot of
the latter to announce the commencement of hostilities between
this country and Persia, on the ground that the latter was endeavouring,
in defiance of Treaties, to subvert the independence of Herat.
The Shah had laid siege to the town, when, in December, the English
fleet, under Admiral Sir Henry Leeke, attacked and captured Bushire
on the Persian Gulf. Soon afterwards, Sir James Outram arrived
on the scene from Bombay, and assumed the command.</p>

<h5>1856</h5>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>5th January 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the drawings for the "Victoria Cross."
She has marked the one she approves with an X; she thinks,
however, that it might be a trifle smaller. The motto would
be better "For Valour" than "For the Brave," as this would
lead to the inference that only those are deemed brave who
have got the Victoria Cross.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>7th January 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter, and in
answer to his question expresses her opinion that Lord Cowley's
presence at the Council of War will be absolutely necessary.<sup>1</sup>
She believes Lord Clarendon to be agreed with her, that the
value of a plan of military campaign is entirely dependent
upon the <i>general policy</i> which the Government intends to
pursue. As none of our Commissioners at the Council of
War are in the least acquainted with the latter, they might be
drawn into plans which would not at all agree with it. Lord
Cowley would take that part of the question into his own
hands, in which it will be quite safe. The Queen thinks that
it is of secondary importance whether Count Walewski attends
or not, but that the Emperor cannot have the same need of
his presence which we have of that of our Ambassador.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 1: A satisfactory and speedy conclusion of hostilities appearing at this time far from probable,
a Council of War to settle the course of operations was, at the Emperor's suggestion,
summoned to meet at Paris. Lord Cowley, Count Walewski, Prince J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Bonaparte,
and others, were present, besides Naval and Military representatives of the Allies, among
whom was the Duke of Cambridge.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">POLICY OF CAVOUR</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>9th January 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has read Sir J. Hudson's<sup>2</sup> letter with much
interest. There is much truth in what Count Cavour says, and
it must ever be our object and our interest to see Sardinia
independent and strong; as a Liberal constitutional country,
opposing a barrier alike to unenlightened and absolute as well
as revolutionary principles&mdash;and this she has a right to expect
us to support her in.</p>

<p class="ind">But <i>what</i> she wants to obtain from Austria is not clear. She
has no right, however, to expect further assurances from us on
wishes which she seems even to be afraid to state distinctly.</p>

<p class="ind">It is clearly impossible to ask Austria to give up a portion
of Italy to her, if nothing has occurred to make this necessary
to Austria. At any rate Sardinia can have lost nothing, but
on the contrary must have gained by the position which she is
placed in as an ally of the Western Powers.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 2: British Minister at Turin, and an enthusiastic sympathiser with Cavour. The latter
had complained to him that if the Austrian proposals were accepted, and peace were
made, Sardinia could expect no realisation of her cherished hopes, viz. Anglo-French
support against Austria and against Papal aggression, increased political consideration in
Europe, and the development of Constitutional Government.
</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>11th January 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen now returns the draft<sup>3</sup> to Lord Bloomfield, which
she could only write about in haste yesterday, as being of a
nature not to be sanctioned by her. It is quite natural and
excusable that our patience should at last be worn out by the
miserable policy which Prussia is pursuing, but it can never
be our interest openly to quarrel with her. This would be
simply playing the game of Russia, who would thus be relieved
from all attacks upon her and see the theatre of the war transferred
to Germany; all other complications (which would
arise therefrom)&mdash;ruinous to the best interests of the Western
Powers as they would be&mdash;the Queen need not refer to. But
when the draft concludes with a declaration to Prussia that
England "<i>considers her neutrality as now at an end</i>," this is
tantamount to a declaration of <i>war!</i> The late articles in our
newspapers, and the language of Count Walewski to Lord
Cowley, make the Queen doubly anxious to warn the Government
not to let themselves be drawn on to such a policy.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 3: The draft expressed disapproval of the silence maintained by the Prussian Government
towards England with regard to the Austrian proposals, of the active measures
adopted to induce the German Powers not to take part with Austria, as well as of the
extended facilities afforded by Prussia to Russia for carrying on the war.

<span class="rightnote">LETTER FROM NAPOLEON III</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Tuileries</span>, <i>le 14 Janvier 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Madame et ch&egrave;re S&oelig;ur</span>,&mdash;Votre Majest&eacute; m'ayant permis
de lui parler &agrave; c&oelig;ur ouvert toutes les fois que des circonstances
graves se pr&eacute;senteraient, je viens aujourd'hui profiter de la
faveur qu'elle a bien voulu m'accorder.</p>

<p class="ind">Je viens de recevoir aujourd'hui la nouvelle de la r&eacute;ponse
de la Russie &agrave; l'Ultimatum de Vienne, et avant d'avoir manifest&eacute;
mon impression &agrave; qui que ce soit, pas m&ecirc;me &agrave; Walewski,
je viens la communiquer &agrave; votre Majest&eacute; pour avoir son avis.</p>

<p class="ind">Je r&eacute;sume la question: La Russie accepte tout l'Ultimatum
autrichien sauf la rectification de fronti&egrave;re de la Bessarabie, et
sauf le paragraphe relatif aux conditions <i>particuli&egrave;res</i> qu'elle
d&eacute;clare ne pas conna&icirc;tre. De plus, profitant du succ&egrave;s de
Kars, elle s'engage &agrave; rendre cette forteresse et le territoire
occup&eacute; en &eacute;change des points que nous poss&eacute;dons en Crim&eacute;e
et ailleurs.</p>

<p class="ind">Dans quelle position allons-nous nous trouver? D'apr&egrave;s
la convention, l'Autriche est oblig&eacute;e de retirer son ambassadeur,
et nous, nous poursuivons la guerre! Mais dans quel
but allons-nous demander &agrave; nos deux pays de nouveaux
sacrifices d'hommes et d'argent? Pour un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t purement
autrichien et pour une question qui ne consolide en rien
l'empire ottoman.</p>

<p class="ind">Cependant nous y sommes oblig&eacute;s et nous ne devons pas
avoir l'air de manquer &agrave; nos engagements. Nous serions donc
plac&eacute;s dans une alternative bien triste si l'Autriche elle-m&ecirc;me
ne semblait pas d&eacute;j&agrave; nous inviter de ne point rompre toute
n&eacute;gociation. Or en r&eacute;fl&eacute;chissant aujourd'hui &agrave; cette situation,
je me disais: ne pourrait-on pas r&eacute;pondre &agrave; l'Autriche ceci:
La prise de Kars a tant soit peu chang&eacute; nos situations; puisque
la Russie consent &agrave; &eacute;vacuer toute l'Asie Mineure nous nous
bornons &agrave; demander pour la Turquie, au lieu de la rectification
de fronti&egrave;re, les places fortes formant <i>t&ecirc;te de pont</i> sur le Danube,
tels que Ismail et Kilia. Pour nous, nous demandons en fait
de conditions particuli&egrave;res, l'engagement de ne point r&eacute;tablir les
forts des &icirc;les d'Aland et une amnistie pour les Tartares. Mon
sentiment est qu'&agrave; ces conditions-l&agrave; la paix serait tr&egrave;s d&eacute;sirable;
car sans cela je ne puis pas m'emp&ecirc;cher de redouter
l'opinion publique quand elle me dira: "Vous aviez obtenu
le but r&eacute;el de la guerre, Aland &eacute;tait tomb&eacute; et ne pouvait plus
se relever, Sebastopol avait eu le m&ecirc;me sort, la flotte Russe
&eacute;tait an&eacute;antie, et la Russie promettait non seulement de ne
plus la faire repara&icirc;tre dans la Mer Noire, mais m&ecirc;me de ne
plus avoir d'arsenaux maritimes sur toutes ses rives; la Russie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.163" id="pageiii.163"></a>[page&nbsp;163]</span>
abandonnait ses conqu&ecirc;tes dans l'Asie Mineure, elle abandonnait
son protectorat dans les principaut&eacute;s, son action sur le
cours du Danube, son influence sur ces correligionnaires sujets
du Sultan, etc., etc. Vous aviez obtenu tout cela non sans
d'immenses sacrifices et cependant vous allez les continuer,
compromettre les finances de la France, r&eacute;pandre ses tr&eacute;sors
et son sang et pourquoi: pour obtenir quelques landes de la
Bessarabie!!!"</p>

Majesty, and concludes that Lord Lansdowne informed your
Majesty that the Cabinet, after hearing from Lord Clarendon
a statement of the course of the recent negotiations as explained
by the despatches which Lord Clarendon read, came
to the decision that no further step should be taken, and no
further communication should be made to the Government of
France on the matters at issue, until the final decision of the
Russian Government on the pure and simple adoption of the
Austrian ultimatum<a id="footnotetagXXV4" name="footnotetagXXV4"></a><a href="#footnoteXXV4"><sup>4</sup></a> should be known. Viscount Palmerston
begs to congratulate your Majesty upon the telegraphic
message received this morning from Sir Hamilton Seymour,
announcing that the Russian Government has adopted that
Austrian ultimatum. So far so well, and the success
which has attended firmness and steadiness of purpose in
regard to those conditions may be looked upon as a tolerably
sure indication that a perseverance in the same course
will bring the Russian Government to consent to those
remaining conditions which the Austrian Government
has not yet (as it says) made known to the Cabinet of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.166" id="pageiii.166"></a>[page&nbsp;166]</span>
for peace throughout the Nation, Viscount Palmerston expressed
his opinion to the Cabinet yesterday that all those
representations were greatly exaggerated. He is convinced
that the Emperor of the French is perfectly master of his own
position, and that he can as to peace or war take the course
which he may determine to adopt.</p>

<p class="ind">The cabal of stock-jobbing politicians, by whom he is surrounded,
<i>must</i> give way to him if he is firm. They have no
standing place in the confidence and respect of their fellow-countrymen,
they represent nothing but the Stock Exchange
speculations in which they are engaged, and the Emperor's
throne would probably be stronger, rather than weaker, if they
were swept away, and better men put in their places. And
it is a very remarkable circumstance that at the very moment
when your Majesty and your Majesty's Government were
being told that the Emperor would be unable to go on with the
war on account of the difficulty of finding money, the French
Government was putting forth in the <i>Moniteur</i> an official
statement showing that they have a reserve surplus of twenty-one
millions sterling for defraying the expenses of a campaign
in the ensuing spring, without the necessity of raising any fresh
loan.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston fully concurs in the sentiment of regret
expressed by your Majesty to Lord Clarendon that the last
action of the war in which your Majesty's troops have been
engaged, should, if peace be now concluded, have been the
repulse at the Redan; but however it may suit national
jealousy, which will always be found to exist on the other side
of the Channel, to dwell upon that check, yet your Majesty may
rely upon it that the Alma and Inkerman have left recollections
which will dwell in the memory of the living and not be forgotten
in the page of history; and although it would no doubt
have been gratifying to your Majesty and to the Nation that
another summer should have witnessed the destruction of
Cronstadt by your Majesty's gallant Navy, and the expulsion of
the Russians from the countries south of the Caucasus by your
Majesty's brave Army, yet if peace <i>can</i> now be concluded on
conditions honourable and secure, it would, as your Majesty
justly observes, not be right to continue the war for the mere
purpose of prospective victories. It will, however, be obviously
necessary to continue active preparations for war up to the
moment when a definite Treaty of Peace is signed, in order that
the Russians may not find it for their interest to break off
negotiations when the season for operations shall approach,
emboldened by any relaxation on the part of the Allies induced
by too ready confidence in the good faith of their adversary....</p>

<span class="rightnote">DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AT PARIS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Tuileries</span>, <i>20th January 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Cousin</span>,&mdash;Your letters of the 14th and 18th have
reached me, and I am happy to find by them that you approve
in conjunction with the Government with what has been done
by me and my colleagues whilst at Paris.<sup>5</sup> I have given all the
messages and carried out all the instructions as contained in
your letters, and I trust as far as possible I have been enabled
to do some good. On the other hand, I cannot deny that the
feelings universally expressed here as to the prospects of a
speedy peace are so different from those felt in England, that it
is extremely difficult to produce any impression in the sense
that we could wish it. France wishes for peace more than
anything else on earth, and this feeling does not confine itself
to Walewski or the Ministers&mdash;it extends itself to all classes.
The Emperor alone is reasonable and sensible in this respect,
but his position is a most painful one, and he feels it very much.
The fact is that public opinion is much more felt and more
loudly expressed in this country than anybody in England at all
imagines. No doubt the Emperor can do much that he wishes,
but still he cannot go altogether against a feeling which so loudly
expresses itself on all occasions, without thereby injuring his
own position most seriously. I have written to Clarendon very
fully on this subject, and have explained to him my reasons
for wishing to return to England as soon as possible, now that
our military mission is concluded. It is essential that I should
see the members of the Government, and that I should communicate
to them the exact state of feeling here and the views
of the Emperor as to the mode of smoothing down all difficulties.
This can only be done by a personal interview on the part of
somebody thoroughly aware of the present position of affairs.
Probably at this moment I am in a better position to do this
than anybody else, from the peculiar circumstances in which I
have been placed while here, and it is this feeling which makes
me desirous to return to England with the least possible delay.
It is my intention therefore to start with my colleagues to-morrow,
Monday night, for England, to which arrangement the
Emperor has given his sanction, and by which time he will be
prepared to tell me what he thinks had best be done, from his
view of the question. I think it my duty to communicate this
to you, and hope that you will give my resolution your sanction.
I beg to remain, my dear Cousin, your most dutiful Cousin,</p>

<span class="rightnote">ENGLAND AND FRANCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>28th January 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sends a letter which she wishes Lord Clarendon
to give to General La Marmora.<sup>6</sup> We have been extremely
pleased with him (indeed he is a universal favourite) and found
him so sensible, mild, and right-minded, in all he says&mdash;and a
valuable adviser to the King. The Queen wishes <i>just</i> to mention
to Lord Clarendon that the Duke of Cambridge told her
that the Emperor had spoken to <i>him</i> about what the King of
Sardinia had said relative to <i>Austria and France</i>, asking the
Duke whether such a thing had been said.<sup>7</sup> The Duke seems
to have answered as we could wish, and the Queen pretended
<i>never</i> to have <i>heard</i> the report, merely saying that as the proposed
ultimatum was then much talked of, it was very possible
the King might unintentionally have mistaken the observations
of the Ministers and ourselves as to our being <i>unable</i> to <i>agree</i>,
without great caution, to what appeared to be <i>agreed</i> on beforehand
between <i>France</i> and <i>Austria</i>, and possibly <i>might</i> have in
his blunt way stated something which alarmed the Emperor&mdash;but
that she could not imagine it could be anything else. There
seems, however, really no <i>end</i> to <i>cancans</i> at <i>Paris</i>; for the
Duke
of Cambridge seems to have shared the same fate. The two
atmospheres of France and England, as well as the Society, are
so different that people get to talk differently. It seems also
that the King got frightened lest he should at Paris be thought
too liberal in his <i>religious</i> views (having been complimented for
it) which he was very proud of&mdash;and thought it necessary to tell
the <i>Emperor</i> he was a <i>good Catholic</i>. This is not unnatural in
his peculiar position. When Lord Clarendon goes to Paris,
he will be able to <i>silence</i> any further allusion to these idle
stories which only lead to mischief, and which even Lord Cowley
seems to have made more of (as to his own feelings upon them)
than was necessary, but that is equally natural. Speaking of
his King&mdash;General La Marmora said: "Il ne dira jamais ce qu'il
ne pense pas, mais il dit quelquefois ce qui serait mieux qu'il
ne dit pas." He more than any other regrets the King's not
having seen more of the world, and says his journey had done
him a <i>great</i> deal of good.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 6: The Sardinian Commander had been attending the Council of War at Paris.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 7: The King of Sardinia was reported to have told the Emperor that the latter's loyalty
to the Alliance was questioned by Great Britain, and that it was conjectured in London
that he was in favour of co-operation with Austria instead.

<span class="rightnote">THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE</span>

<p class="indright"><i>28th January 1856.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns to Lord Palmerston the draft of the speech,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.169" id="pageiii.169"></a>[page&nbsp;169]</span>
which she thinks <i>extremely well</i> worded, and which she therefore
trusts will be (with the exception of those passages marked)
as little altered as possible. Lord John Russell used to say
that as soon as a speech was discussed in the Cabinet, it was
so much <i>pruned</i> and altered as to lose all its force. The Queen
must own that she is <i>much</i> alarmed at hearing that the <i>papers</i>
of the War Council were to be printed and circulated amongst
the Cabinet, as she fears that the secrecy, which is so necessary,
upon which the Emperor laid so <i>much stress</i>, will be
very difficult to be maintained. The Emperor's opinion at
least, the Queen hopes, will <i>not</i> be printed or generally
circulated?</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must again press for a very early decision on the
subject. If this is allowed to <i>drag</i>, it will appear, particularly
to the <i>Emperor</i>, as if we were not really in earnest, though we
stickled so much for our additional conditions, which might
lessen the hopes of peace. Of course the Government must not
give any answer on this subject&mdash;should Parliament be so
indiscreet as to ask <i>what</i> the result of the deliberations of the
Council of War has been.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to Lord Clarendon's observation that he hopes
that the Queen "will approve of his upholding the Sardinians
in the Conference and in all other respects," she can only assure
him that she is <i>most sincerely</i> anxious that he should do so, as
the Queen has the greatest respect for that noble little country,
which, since it has possessed an honest, straightforward as well

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;I had the happiness of receiving your
kind letter of the 8th on Saturday, and thank you much for it.
I gave your kind message to Colonel Phipps, who was much
gratified by it. We came here in wretched weather yesterday,
leaving Mamma <i>still</i> at Frogmore.</p>

<p class="ind">The Conferences will begin very shortly; Lord Clarendon

feelings to speak upon the subject.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to your answer respecting your <i>neutrality</i>, and
the possibility of your being obliged to break it, I must repeat
that I see <i>no possibility</i> or <i>eventuality</i> that <i>could oblige</i>
you to
do so. <i>Belgium</i> of its own accord bound itself to remain neutral,
and its very existence is <i>based</i> upon that neutrality, which
the other Powers have guaranteed and are bound to maintain

would start soon. If <i>he</i> can't come himself, he should send his
son for a few days, who could bring us any confidential communication

us. Something of this kind is most necessary, for it is overwhelming
to write to one another upon so many details which

truth, that a letter to be a good letter ought to be as if one
heard the person speak; your dear letters are always so, and
you would therefore be praised by Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, and
that very deservedly. Lord Clarendon is, Heaven be praised,
well calculated to bring matters to a happy conclusion. I will
try to make some impression on the mind of the Emperor
Alexander, his best policy will be the most honest. By all I
can learn they wish most sincerely the conclusion of this war.
If on the side of the Allies only the things which really protect
the territories of the present Turkish Empire are asked, the
Russians ought not to man&oelig;uvre, but grant it, and the Allies
also ought to be moderate. You are very properly never
to be contradicted, but there are a few things to be remarked.
This neutrality was in the real interest of this country, but our
good Congress here did <i>not</i> wish it, and even opposed it; it was
<i>impos&eacute;</i> upon them. A neutrality to be respected must be
<i>protected</i>. France at all time in cases of general war can put
an end to it, by declaring to us <i>Vous devez &ecirc;tre avec nous ou
contre nous</i>. If we answer <i>Nous sommes neutres</i>, they will
certainly try to occupy us; then the case of self-defence arises
and the claim to be protected by the other powers....</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>16th February 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The subject to which Lord Palmerston refers in his letter

to-day, has also caused the Queen much anxiety.</p>

<p class="ind">A Civil Commission is sent out by the Government to enquire
into the conduct of the officers in command in the Crimea; this
is done without any consultation with the Commander-in-Chief.
They report to the Government, inculpating several
general officers and others in high command; this report is
not communicated to the military authorities, nor to the persons
affected by it, but is laid on the table of both Houses of
Parliament.<sup>12</sup> These officers then for the first time find themselves
accused under the authority of Government, and that
accusation communicated to the Legislature without ever
having been heard in answer or allowed an opportunity to
defend themselves. It is stated in both Houses by the Government
that the officers may send papers in reply if they choose!
But who is to be the Judge on the trial? The Press, of course,
and the <i>Times</i> at the head, have already judged and condemned,
and the House of Commons is now moving <i>in default of another

<p class="ind">It is quite evident if matters are left so, and military officers

they have discharged their military duties before an enemy by

taking any steps of their own!</p>

<p class="ind">The course suggested by Sir James Graham and alluded to
by Lord Palmerston, of following the precedent of the enquiry
into the Convention of Cintra,<sup>13</sup> appears therefore to the Queen
to be the only prudent one.</p>

their statements beforehand, as these will not go before judges
feeling the weight of their responsibility, but before the newspapers
who are their sworn enemies and determined to effect
their ruin, for which they possess unlimited means.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 12: Sir John MacNeill and Colonel Tulloch had been sent out to the Crimea early in 1855
to investigate the breakdown of various military departments. They had issued a preliminary
report in the summer of 1855, and a final one in January 1856, which was presented
to Parliament. The officers specially censured were Lord Lucan (who had been
given the command of a Regiment), Lord Cardigan, Inspector of Cavalry, Sir Richard
Airey, Quartermaster-General, and Colonel Gordon, Deputy Quartermaster-General.
Lord Panmure wrote on the 17th of February that the Government recommended the
appointment of a Commission of Enquiry, consisting of General Sir Howard Douglas
and six other high military officers. The Commission sat at Chelsea, and made its report
in July, exonerating the officers censured.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 13: The Convention of Cintra was concluded on the 30th of August 1808. It was founded
on the basis of an armistice agreed upon between Sir Arthur Wellesley and General
Kellerman, on the day after the battle of Vimiera, and some of its provisions were considered
too favourable to the French. A Board of Enquiry, under the presidency of Sir
David Dundas, in the first instance exculpated the British officers; but the Government
having instructed the members of the Board to give their opinions individually, four were
found to approve and three to disapprove the armistice and convention.

<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR'S CORDIALITY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Paris</span>, <i>18th February 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and humbly begs to say that he dined last night at the
Tuileries, and had a conversation of two hours with the
Emperor, which was in all respects satisfactory. On no
occasion has Lord Clarendon heard the Emperor express himself
more warmly or with greater determination in favour of
the Alliance, and H.M. entirely concurred with Lord Clarendon,
that upon the perfect understanding between the two Governments,
and the conviction on the part of others that the
Alliance was not to be shaken, depended the facility with
which negotiations might be conducted, and the terms on
which peace would be made. Lord Clarendon spoke with the
utmost frankness about the flattery that had been and would
continue to be addressed to His Majesty, and the contrast
perpetually drawn between England and France, to the disparagement
of the former, for the purpose of disturbing the
relations between them; but that your Majesty and your
Majesty's Government had always treated these tricks with
contempt, because the confidence in the Emperor's honour
and loyalty was complete. Lord Clarendon dwelt particularly
upon the feelings of your Majesty and of the Prince on
this subject, and the pleasure it gave the Emperor was evident;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.176" id="pageiii.176"></a>[page&nbsp;176]</span>
and he desired Lord Clarendon to say that your Majesty should
never find such confidence misplaced.</p>

<p class="ind">He promised Lord Clarendon that he would give Baron
Brunnow and Count Buol to understand that if they thought
the Alliance could be disturbed by them they would find themselves
grievously mistaken, and that it would be waste of time
to try and alter any conditions upon which he had agreed with
the English Government.</p>

<p class="ind">The Emperor appeared to be much gratified by your Majesty's
letter, for the first thing he said to Lord Clarendon on coming
into the room before dinner was "<i>quelle charmante lettre vous
m'avez apport&eacute;e de la Reine</i>," and then began upon the extraordinary
clearness with which your Majesty treated all matters
of business, and the pleasure he derived from every discussion
of them with your Majesty....</p>

<p class="ind">The Empress was looking in great health and beauty. She
was in the highest spirits, and full of affectionate enquiry for
your Majesty.</p>

<span class="rightnote">OUDH</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Calcutta</span>, <i>19th February 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General presents his most humble duty to
your Majesty, and has the honour of submitting to your Majesty
a copy of a Proclamation, whereby the Kingdom of Oudh has
been placed exclusively and permanently under the authority
of your Majesty's Government.<a id="footnotetagXXV14" name="footnotetagXXV14"></a><a href="#footnoteXXV14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p class="ind">The various considerations, and the course of public events,
which led to this necessity, have long since been laid before
your Majesty's Government in great detail.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General during the past summer communicated
to the Home Authorities his readiness to remain in India
as long as he dared, namely, for one additional month, until
the 1st of March, for the purpose of carrying into effect the
proposed policy regarding Oudh&mdash;if it was desired that he
should do so.</p>

<p class="ind">The orders from the Home Government reached the Governor-General
only upon the 2nd of January, leaving barely two
months for the assembling of the military force which was
necessary to provide against all risks&mdash;for the negotiations with
the King&mdash;and for the organisation of the future Civil and
Military Administration of Oudh.</p>

<p class="ind">Every preparation having been completed, the Resident at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.177" id="pageiii.177"></a>[page&nbsp;177]</span>
Lucknow waited upon the King in person&mdash;communicated to
him the resolution which the British Government had taken&mdash;and
tendered for his acceptance a new Treaty, whereby the
transfer of the Government of Oudh would have been made a
matter of amicable agreement.</p>

<p class="ind">The King wholly refused to sign any Treaty. He declared
himself ready to submit to the will of the British Government
in all things. He bade the Resident observe that every mark
of power had already been laid down by His Majesty's own
orders&mdash;the guns at the palace gates were dismounted, the
guards bore no arms, and, though drawn up as usual in the
Court, they saluted the Resident with their hands only;
while not a weapon was worn by any officer in the Palace.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE KING'S APPEAL</span>
<p class="ind">The King gave way to passionate bursts of grief and anger&mdash;implored
the intercession of the Resident in his behalf&mdash;and
finally, uncovering his head, he placed his turban in the Resident's
hands. This act&mdash;the deepest mark of humiliation and
helplessness which a native of the East can exhibit&mdash;became
doubly touching and significant when the head thus bared in
supplication was one that had worn a royal crown.</p>

<p class="ind">The Government, however, had already borne too long with
the wrongs inflicted by the sovereigns of Oudh upon their
unhappy subjects. The clamorous grief of the King could not
be allowed to shut out the cry of his people's misery. The
King's appeal, therefore, could not be listened to; and as His
Majesty, at the end of the three days' space which was allowed
him for deliberation, still resolutely refused to sign a Treaty, the
territory of Oudh was taken possession of, by the issue of the
Proclamation which has now been respectfully submitted to
your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">It is the fourth kingdom in India which has passed under
your Majesty's sceptre during the last eight years.<sup>15</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Perfect tranquillity has prevailed in Oudh since the event
which has just been narrated. General Outram writes that
the populace of Lucknow, more interested than any other
community in the maintenance of the native dynasty, already
"appear to have forgotten they ever had a King." In the
districts the Proclamation has been heartily welcomed by
the middle and lower classes; while even the higher orders,
who of course lose much in a native state by the cessation
of corruption and tyranny, have shown no symptoms of
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class="ind">There seems every reason to hope and expect that the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.178" id="pageiii.178"></a>[page&nbsp;178]</span>
complete tranquillity will attend the further progress of our
arrangements for the future administration of Oudh....</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General has only further to report to your
Majesty that Lord Canning arrived at Madras on the 14th
inst., and that he will assume the Government of India on
the last day of this month.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General will report hereafter Lord Canning's
arrival at Fort William; and he has now the honour to subscribe

<span class="rightnote">LORD CLARENDON'S INSTRUCTIONS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, [<i>? March</i>] <i>1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns these letters to Lord Palmerston. She
entirely concurs in Lord Palmerston's general views of the
question, but at the same time she thinks&mdash;as circumstances,
which are beyond our control, may so vary from day to day
or even from hour to hour&mdash;that Lord Clarendon should receive
full powers to act according to what may appear to him to be
best and wisest at the time, even if it should not be in strict
accordance with what we originally contemplated and must
naturally wish. Such a power would certainly not be misplaced
in Lord Clarendon's hands; his firmness, and his sense
of what this country expects, are too well known to lead us to
doubt of his permitting anything but what would <i>really</i> be for
the best of this country, and for the maintenance of the
Alliance.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>6th March 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">With reference to Lord Clarendon's letter, the Queen must
say that she, though <i>very reluctantly</i>, shares his opinion, that
we have no choice <i>now</i> but to accept the peace, even if it is not
all we could desire, and if another campaign might have got
us better terms. She feels certain that the bad accounts of the
French Army in the Crimea, which appears to suffer <i>now</i> all
the misery which ours suffered last year at the worst time of
the siege, will more than ever indispose the Emperor from risking
a renewal of hostilities. It is affirmed that the French
have beyond 20,000 men in hospital!</p>

<p class="ind">If we are to have this peace, however, the Queen must again
agree with Lord Clarendon that we ought not <i>ourselves</i> to
depreciate it, as our Press has done the deeds of our Army.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to the principalities, it is the Queen's opinion
that nothing will oppose a barrier to Russia and her intrigues
but the arrangement which will satisfy the people themselves,
viz. an <i>hereditary monarchy</i>. The example of Egypt might
perfectly well be followed in Wallachia and Moldavia.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.181" id="pageiii.181"></a>[page&nbsp;181]</span>

<p class="ind">The subject of Poland would, in the Queen's opinion, be
much better left unintroduced into the present negotiations;
we have no claim arising out of this war to ask Russia to make
concessions on that head, which, moreover, would be treated
by her as an internal question not admitting of foreign interference.</p>

<p class="ind">The clause in the Treaty of Vienna about the Bonapartes is
a dead letter, as this very Treaty, now to be signed, will prove,
and the Emperor would act very unwisely to call for an alteration
in which all Powers who signed the original Treaty would
claim to be consulted. We have every interest not to bring
about a European Congress <i>pour la R&eacute;vision des Trait&eacute;s</i>, which
many people suspect the Emperor wishes to turn the present
Conference into.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes only to add that, should Prussia be asked
to join in the final Treaty on the ground of her having been a
party to the July Treaty, we should take care that it does not
appear that this was an act of courtesy of all the other Powers
towards Prussia except England, who need not be made to take
additional unpopularity in Germany upon herself.</p>

"it makes one feel as if additional light were thrown upon the

Cabinet should have any amendments to propose; and Lord
Clarendon humbly hopes that your Majesty may not be displeased
at his not having acted upon this injunction, because he
had promised to sign the Treaty to-morrow in accordance with
the general wish of the Congress, notwithstanding that it was
Sunday, and he could not therefore go back from his engagement&mdash;every
preparation is made for illuminations, not alone
at Paris, but throughout France, as all the Prefects have been
informed of the signature&mdash;the odium that would have fallen
[on] us all would have been extreme throughout Europe it
may be said, and it would have been regarded as a last proof of
our unwillingness to make peace. The friendly feeling of the
Congress towards the English P.P.'s<sup>20</sup> would have changed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.183" id="pageiii.183"></a>[page&nbsp;183]</span>
they probably would have agreed to no amendments, requiring
that all the seven copies of the Treaty should be recopied. In
short, Lord Clarendon felt that he had no choice but to take

of Europe. Greater and more brilliant successes by land and
sea might probably have been accomplished by the Allies if the
war had continued, but any great and important additional
security against future aggressions by Russia could only have
been obtained by severing from Russia large portions of her
frontier territory, such as Finland, Poland, and Georgia; and
although by great military and financial efforts and sacrifices
those territories might for a time have been occupied, Russia
must have been reduced to the lowest state of internal distress,
before her Emperor could have been brought to put his name
to a Treaty of Peace finally surrendering his sovereignty over
those extensive countries; and to have continued the war long
enough for these purposes would have required greater endurance
than was possessed by your Majesty's Allies, and might
possibly have exhausted the good-will of your Majesty's own subjects....</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE TREATY OF PARIS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Paris</span>, <i>30th March 1856.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and humbly begs to congratulate your Majesty upon the
signature of peace this afternoon. It is not to be doubted that
another campaign must have brought glory to your Majesty's
arms, and would have enabled England to impose different
terms upon Russia, but setting aside the cost and the horrors of
war, in themselves evils of the greatest magnitude, we cannot
feel sure that victory might not have been purchased too dearly&mdash;a
continuation of the war would hardly have been possible
either with or without France&mdash;if we had dragged her on with
us it would have been most reluctantly on her part, her finances
would have suffered still more, she would have borne us ill-will,
would have acted feebly with us, and would on the first favourable
occasion have left us in the lurch. If we had continued
the war single-handed, France would feel that she had behaved
shabbily to us, and would <i>therefore</i> have hated us all the more, and
become our enemy sooner than under any other circumstances;
a coalition of Europe might then have taken place against
England, to which the United States would but too gladly have
adhered, and the consequence might have been most serious.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon would not make such an assertion lightly,
but he feels convinced that your Majesty may feel satisfied with
the position now occupied by England&mdash;six weeks ago it was a
painful position here, everybody was against us, our motives
were suspected, and our policy was denounced; but the universal
feeling now is that we are the only country able and ready,
and willing, if necessary, to continue the war; that we might
have prevented peace, but that having announced our readiness
to make peace on honourable terms we have honestly and unselfishly
acted up to our word. It is well known, too, that the
conditions on which peace is made would have been different if
England had not been firm, and everybody is, of course, glad <i>even
here</i> that peace should not have brought dishonour to France.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon, therefore, ventures to hope that the language
in England with respect to the peace will not be apologetic
or dissatisfied. It would be unwise and undignified, and
would invite criticism if such language were held before the
conditions are publicly known.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>31st March 1856.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thanks Lord Clarendon much for his two letters
of Saturday and yesterday; and we congratulate <i>him</i> on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.185" id="pageiii.185"></a>[page&nbsp;185]</span>
success of his <i>efforts</i> in obtaining the Peace, for to him <i>alone</i>
it is due, and also <i>to him alone</i> is due the dignified position which
the Queen's beloved country holds, and which she owes to a
straightforward, steady, and unselfish policy throughout.</p>

<p class="ind">Much as the Queen disliked the idea of <i>Peace</i>, she has become
reconciled to it, by the conviction that France would either
not have continued the war, or continued it in such a manner
that <i>no</i> glory could have been hoped for for us.</p>

<p class="ind">We have a striking proof of this in P&eacute;lissier not having
obeyed the Emperor's orders and never having thought of
occupying Sak.<sup>22</sup> <i>This really might</i> be hinted to the Emperor....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen finds Lord Palmerston very well pleased with the
Peace, though he struggled as long as he could for better conditions....</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 22: The word is so written in the original draft. There was a place of the name near Old
Fort in the Crimea, but this is more probably an abbreviation for Sakatal in Caucasia.

<span class="rightnote">HONOURS GRATEFULLY DECLINED</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Paris</span>, <i>6th April 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon humbly begs in Lord Cowley's name and his
own most gratefully to acknowledge the kind and gracious
intention of your Majesty to raise each of them a step in the
Peerage, and they venture to hope that your Majesty will not
have been displeased at their having respectfully declined this
great distinction. Lord Cowley's reason was his extreme
poverty, and the feeling that an accession of rank would only
aggravate the inconvenience he already experiences from being
a Peer....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon felt that courtesy titles to his younger
sons would be a positive injury to them in working for their
bread, and he relied upon your Majesty's unvarying kindness
for appreciating his reluctance to prefer himself to his children.
He may, with entire truth, add that the knowledge that your
Majesty has approved of their conduct is ample and abundant
reward for Lord Cowley and himself. Lord Clarendon hopes
it is not presumptuous in him to say that he would not exchange
your Majesty's letters of approval for any public mark of your
Majesty's favour....</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>11th April 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Now that the moment for the ratification of the Treaty of
Peace is near at hand, the Queen wishes to delay no longer the
expression of her satisfaction as to the manner in which both
the War has been brought to a conclusion, and the honour and
interests of this country have been maintained by the Treaty
of Peace, under the zealous and able guidance of Lord Palmerston.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.187" id="pageiii.187"></a>[page&nbsp;187]</span>
She wishes as a public token of her approval to bestow
the Order of the Garter upon him. Should the two vacant
Ribbons already have been promised to the Peers whose names
Lord Palmerston has on a former occasion submitted to the
Queen, there could be no difficulty in his being named an
extra Knight, not filling up the next vacancy which may
occur; this course was followed when Lord Grey received the
Garter from the hands of King William.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>11th April 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and is unable to express in words the gratification
and thankfulness which he feels upon the receipt of your
Majesty's most gracious and unexpected communication of
this morning. The utmost of his ambition has been so to perform
the duties of the high position in which your Majesty has
been pleased to place him, as to prove himself not unworthy of
the confidence with which your Majesty has honoured him;
and the knowledge that your Majesty has found no reason to
be dissatisfied with your choice; and that his endeavour
properly to discharge his duties to your Majesty and the
country have met with your Majesty's approval would of
itself be an ample reward for any labour or anxiety with which
the performance of those duties may have been attended, and,
therefore, the gracious communication which he has this
morning received from your Majesty will be preserved by him
as in his eyes still more valuable even than the high honour
which it announces your Majesty's intention to confer upon him.</p>

<p class="ind">That high and distinguished honour Viscount Palmerston
will receive with the greatest pride as a public mark of your
Majesty's gracious approbation, but he begs to be allowed to
say that the task which he and his colleagues have had to
perform has been rendered comparatively easy by the enlightened
views which your Majesty has taken of all the great
affairs in which your Majesty's Empire has been engaged, and
by the firm and steady support which <i>in</i> all these important
transactions your Majesty's servants have received from the
Crown.</p>

<p class="ind">She trusts and <i>expects</i> that this will be done with great

have had, and the sufferings which we have endured, may not
be forgotten, for to the miserable reductions of the last thirty
years are entirely owing our state of <i>helplessness</i> when the War
began; and it would be unpardonable if we were to be found
in a similar condition, when another War&mdash;and <i>who</i> can tell
<i>how</i> soon there may be one?&mdash;breaks out.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has heard from Colonel Phipps that Lord
Hardinge is most anxious for her sanction to the paper submitted
yesterday, if even as merely a temporary measure,
before the mail goes this evening, as all the shipping at Balaklava
is waiting for it. She hopes Lord Hardinge will see how
inconvenient and unpleasant it must be to the Queen to have
important matters submitted at such short notice that they
cannot even be discussed by her without detriment to the
public service, and trusts that she may not again be placed in
a similar position. She has now signed the paper, but <i>only</i>
as a temporary measure, and upon the understanding that
Lord Hardinge will submit to her, between this and the next
mail, the arrangements which are now wanting.</p>

<p class="ind">She has also signed the proposal about Canada, but must
express her conviction that General Le Marchant,<sup>25</sup> as Civil
Governor of the Colony, cannot possibly attend to the command

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Mr Labouchere's letter, and hastens
to express her opinion that Mr Wilson<sup>27</sup> would not be at all a
proper person to be Governor of so large and important a
Colony as Victoria. It ought to be a man of higher position
and standing, and who could represent his Sovereign
adequately....</p>

<p class="ind">She wishes further to observe that Mr Labouchere should in
future take care that, while he tries to ascertain the feelings of
people as to their accepting the offer of a Colonial appointment,
before he submits them to the Queen, that these enquiries
should be made in such a manner as not to lead these
persons to <i>expect</i> the appointment, else, if the <i>Queen</i> does not
approve of them, the whole odium of the refusal will fall upon
her. The best way, and the way in which similar appointments
are conducted in the other Offices, would be to mention
the names first to the Queen, and if she approves of them,
to ascertain the feelings of the respective candidates. This
would avoid all difficulties on the subject.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen would quite approve of the selection of Sir H.
Bulwer, Lord Lyttelton, or Sir H. Barkly for Victoria. She is
decidedly of opinion that the Governor should be an Englishman
and not a Colonist. Now that self-Government has been
established in the Colonies, the person of the Governor is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.191" id="pageiii.191"></a>[page&nbsp;191]</span>
only connection remaining with the Mother Country; and if
the Government were once filled from among the public men

to break through again, and possibly paving the way for total
separation.<sup>28</sup></p>

<span class="rightnote">NAVAL POLICY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>18th May 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has to thank Sir C. Wood for his long and clear
statement as to the present position of the Naval Force, which
she quite understands. She attaches the greatest importance
to perfect faith being kept with the sailors, and on that account
was distressed to hear of the misapprehension at Portsmouth
the other day.</p>

<p class="ind">A good system for a Naval Reserve would be most important.
The Queen thinks a Commission, composed chiefly
of <i>younger officers</i> still conversant with the <i>present</i> feelings of
our sailors, would best be able to advise on the subject; the
old Admirals are always and not unnaturally somewhat behind
their time.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the policy of not too rapidly reducing our
naval armaments, Sir C. Wood only anticipates the Queen's
most anxious wish on this subject, for we cannot tell what may
not happen anywhere at any moment; our relations with
America are very unsettled, and our Alliance with France <i>depends</i>
upon the life of one man. And it is best to be prepared,
for else you excite suspicion if you have suddenly to make preparations
without being <i>able</i> to state for what they are intended.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to the Sailors' Homes, the Queen concurs in
the advantage of leaving them to private management; but
the Government, having so large a stake in the sailors' welfare,
would act wisely and justly to make a handsome donation to
all of them at the present moment, taking care that this should
be used by the different establishments for their permanent
extension. Five thousand pounds amongst them would be
by no means an unreasonable sum to give as a token of the
interest taken in the well-being of these brave men when no
immediate return in shape of service was expected for it.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.192" id="pageiii.192"></a>[page&nbsp;192]</span>
Hardinge's proposals are before the Government already for
some time, no proposal has yet been submitted to the Queen;
and on enquiry from Sir C. Wood, he stated but two days ago
that no reduction of the Navy was yet settled. On the other
hand, the Queen sees from the Chancellor of the Exchequer's
speech that he specifies the sums by which both Army and
Navy estimates are to be reduced. This <i>prejudges</i> the whole
question, and will deprive the Government of all power freely
to consider these important questions. The Queen was, moreover,
sorry to find Mr Disraeli, Mr Gladstone, and Sir Francis
Baring agreeing with the doctrine of the <i>Times</i> and Lord Grey
that we ought <i>not</i> to improve our state of preparation for war;
and if we had been better prepared for the late war, we should
have been still more disappointed.<sup>29</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 29: In the course of an elaborate reply, Lord Palmerston stated that the country had
never been in a better condition of defence than at the present time, but he insisted that
the Militia, which from 1815 to 1832 had been allowed to become extinct, must be maintained
in an efficient state&mdash;120,000 strong.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">TITLE OF PRINCE CONSORT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>May 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">It is a strange omission in our Constitution that while <i>the
wife</i> of a <i>King</i> has the highest rank and dignity in the realm
after her husband assigned to her by law, the <i>husband</i> of a
<i>Queen regnant</i> is entirely ignored by the law. This is the more
extraordinary, as a husband has in this country such particular
rights and such great power over his wife, and as the
Queen is married just as any other woman is, and swears to
obey her lord and master, as such, while by law he has no rank
or defined position. This is a strange anomaly. No doubt,
as is the case <i>now</i>&mdash;the Queen <i>can</i> give her husband the highest
<i>place</i> by <i>placing</i> him <i>always near her person</i>, and the Nation
would give it him as a <i>matter of course</i>. Still, when I first
married, we had much difficulty on this subject; much bad
feeling was shown, and several members of the Royal Family
showed bad grace in giving precedence to the Prince, and the
late King of Hanover positively resisted doing so. I gave the
Prince precedence by issuing Letters Patent, but these give
no rank in Parliament&mdash;or at the Council Board&mdash;and it would
be far better to put this question beyond all doubt, and to
secure its settlement for <i>all future Consorts of Queens</i>, and thus
have this omission in the Constitution rectified. Naturally
my own feeling would be to give the Prince the same title and
rank as I have, but a Titular King is a complete novelty in
this country, and might be productive of more inconveniences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.193" id="pageiii.193"></a>[page&nbsp;193]</span>
than advantages to the individual who bears it. Therefore,
upon mature reflection, and after considering the question for
nearly <i>sixteen years</i>, I have come to the conclusion that the
title which is now by universal consent given him of "Prince
Consort," with the highest rank in and out of Parliament<span class="rightnote">PRECEDENCE OF PRINCE ALBERT</span>
immediately after the Queen, and before every other Prince of
the Royal Family, should be the one assigned to the husband
of the Queen regnant <i>once and for all</i>. This ought to be done
before our children grow up, and it seems peculiarly easy to do
so <i>now</i> that none of the old branches of the Royal Family are
still alive.</p>

<p class="ind">The present position is this: that while every British subject,
down to the Knight, Bachelor, Doctor, and Esquire, has
a rank and position by <i>Law</i>, the Queen's husband alone has
one by <i>favour</i>&mdash;and by his wife's favour, who may grant it
or not! When granted as in the present case, it does not
extend to Parliament and the Council, and the children may
deny the position which their mother has given to their father
as a usurpation over them, having the law on their side; or
if they waive their rights in his favour, he will hold a position
granted by the forbearance of his children. In both cases this
is a position most derogatory to the Queen as well as to her
husband, and most dangerous to the peace and well-being of
her family. If the children resist, the Queen will have her
husband pushed away from her side by her children, and they
will take precedence over the man whom she is bound to obey;
if they are dutiful, she will owe her peace of mind to their
continued generosity.</p>

<p class="ind">With relation to Foreign Courts, the Queen's position is
equally humiliating in this respect. <i>Some</i> Sovereigns (crowned
heads) address her husband as "Brother," some as "Brother
and Cousin," some merely as "Cousin." When the Queen
has been abroad, her husband's position has always been a
subject of negotiation and vexation; the position which has
been accorded to him the Queen has always had to acknowledge
as a grace and favour bestowed on her by the Sovereign
whom she visited. While last year the Emperor of the French
treated the Prince as a Royal personage, his uncle declined to
come to Paris avowedly because he would not give precedence
to the Prince; and on the Rhine in 1845 the King of Prussia
could not give the place to the Queen's husband which common
civility required, because of the presence of an Archduke,
the third son of an uncle of the then reigning Emperor of
Austria, who would not give the <i>pas</i>, and whom the King
would not offend.</p>

<p class="ind">The only legal position in Europe, according to international
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.194" id="pageiii.194"></a>[page&nbsp;194]</span>
law, which the husband of the Queen of England enjoys, is
that of a younger brother of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, and this
merely because the English law does not know of him. This
is derogatory to the dignity of the Crown of England.</p>

<p class="ind">But <i>nationally</i> also it is an injury to the position of the Crown
that the Queen's husband should have no other title than that
of Prince of Saxe-Coburg, and thus be perpetually represented
to the country as a foreigner. "The Queen and her foreign
husband, the Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha!"</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has a right to claim that her husband should be
an Englishman, bearing an English title, and enjoying a legal
position which she has not to defend with a wife's anxiety
as a usurpation against her own children, her subjects, and
Foreign Courts.</p>

<p class="ind">The question has often been discussed by me with different
Prime Ministers and Lord Chancellors, who have invariably
entirely agreed with me; but the wish to wait for a good
moment to bring the matter before Parliament has caused one
year after another to elapse without anything being done.
If I become <i>now</i> more anxious to have it settled, it is in order
that it should be so before our children are grown up, that it
might not appear to be done in order to guard their father's
position against them personally, which could not fail to
produce a painful impression upon their minds.</p>

<p class="ind">If properly explained to Parliament and the country, I
cannot foresee the slightest difficulty in getting such a necessary
measure passed, particularly if it be made quite clear to
the House of Commons that it is in no way connected with a
desire to obtain an increased grant for the Prince.<sup>30</sup></p>

to prevent the military bands from playing when the Troops
march to church on a Sunday.</p>

<p class="ind">She is anxious to express to Lord Hardinge her very strong

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;I hasten to thank you for your very
kind letter of yesterday, just received. Your kind <i>question</i>
puts me into considerable perplexity, and I think I cannot
do better than by putting you in full possession of the state of
the case.</p>

<p class="ind">Our house is very full&mdash;and it is <i>possible</i> that we may have
very shortly the visit of Prince Oscar of Sweden. These
Princes have very large <i>suites</i>, and I should therefore in such
a case be totally unable to lodge you and <i>them</i>. But there is
another reason. While Fritz Wilhelm is here, <i>every</i> spare
moment Vicky has (and <i>I</i> have, for I must chaperon this
loving couple&mdash;which takes away so much of my precious
time) is devoted to her bridegroom, who is <i>so</i> much in love,
that, even if he is out driving and walking with her, he is not
satisfied, and says he has not seen her, unless he can have her
for an hour to himself, when I am naturally bound to be acting
as chaperon. Under these circumstances I may truly say that
dear Charlotte would have very little enjoyment; she would
see very little of Vicky, <i>I could not</i> take care of her, and I fear
it would be anything but agreeable for her. Fritz Wilhelm
would besides be miserable if I took Vicky more away from
him than I already do, and therefore <i>while he</i> is here, it would
<i>not</i>, I think, be advisable that <i>Charlotte</i> should come. Could
you <i>not</i> come a little in August when the Prince and Princess
of Prussia have left us? Or would you prefer coming in
October, when we return from Scotland? You will easily
believe, dearest Uncle, <i>what</i> pleasure it gives me to see you;
but I know you will understand the reasons I here give for
begging you to delay this dear visit either to August or
October....</p>

<p class="ind">I had a little hope that the Archduke and Charlotte <i>might</i>
take a mutual liking; it would be such a good <i>parti</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">We had an interesting ceremony yesterday, the laying of the
first stone of the Wellington College&mdash;which is the monument
to the memory of the dear old Duke. Dear little Arthur
appeared for the first time in public, and I hope you will

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty ... will be prepared,
as well as Lord Lyndhurst, to give his cordial support to such
a Bill as that sketched out by the Lord Chancellor; but using
that freedom which is invited by and due to the gracious confidence
reposed in him by your Majesty, he hopes he may be
pardoned for earnestly submitting to your Majesty's serious
consideration the question whether it may be expedient to
raise a discussion on such a subject during the short remainder
of the present Session of Parliament. Measures of public
importance already in progress are now beginning to be abandoned
in consequence of the advanced period of the Session,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.197" id="pageiii.197"></a>[page&nbsp;197]</span>
and Lord Lyndhurst concurs very strongly in Lord Derby's
apprehensions as to the result on public feeling of the introduction
of such a measure at the present moment. If it could
be stated that your Majesty contemplated a foreign visit in the
course of the summer, which rendered it desirable that a
measure should be passed to obviate the embarrassment which
had been created on previous occasions of the same sort, some
case might be made out for immediate legislation, though even
then the question would arise why it was not thought of sooner;
but in the absence of any change of circumstances, and in the
present unfortunate temper of the House of Commons, of
which a proof was given last night, such a course would probably
lead to suspicions and remarks of the most painful character.
It would be said, and with some justice, that the
greater the constitutional importance of a settlement, the
greater was also the necessity of ample opportunity for
consideration being given to Parliament; and the hurry of
passing the Bill would be cited as a proof that it covered
some unavowed and objectionable design. If such suspicions
should lead to the postponement of the measure, not only
would the Crown have been subjected to a mortifying defeat,
but the Bill would be open to the hostile criticisms of the
Press during the whole summer and autumn, the effect of which
might even endanger its ultimate success....</p>

<p class="ind">Should your Majesty be otherwise advised, Lord Derby will be
ready to give the Bill his personal support, but he would be
wanting in candour if he did not frankly state to your Majesty
the serious apprehensions which he should entertain as to the
result. Such an unreserved expression of his opinions is the
only and very inadequate return which he can make to your
Majesty for the gracious confidence with which your Majesty
has honoured him, and for which he feels most deeply grateful.</p>

<p class="ind">With Mr Labouchere's humble duty to Her Majesty. Mr
Labouchere begs to submit the following observations in reply
to Her Majesty's enquiries respecting the Free States in the
vicinity of the British Colonies in South Africa.</p>

<p class="ind">There are two independent States there:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind">(1.) The Transvaal Republic, founded by Boers who left the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.201" id="pageiii.201"></a>[page&nbsp;201]</span>
Colony for the most part from ten to fifteen years ago. The
territory on which they are established never was British.
The Government of the day, thinking it useless and impolitic
to pursue them there, entered into a capitulation with them
and recognised their independent existence. They inhabit the
plains north of the Vaal or Yellow River.</p>

<p class="ind">(2.) The Orange River Free State. This occupies the
territory between the Vaal River to the north and the Orange
River to the south. This territory, like the former, was
occupied originally by emigrant Boers, and was beyond the
boundaries of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope. But Sir
Harry Smith, in 1849, after a severe military struggle with the
Boers, thought proper without authority from home to annex
it to British Dominion.<sup>37</sup> This annexation was ratified by Lord
Grey, and the country remained for three or four years under
British rule. Afterwards it was resolved to abandon it, during
the administration of the Duke of Newcastle, as a result of the
general revision of our affairs which took place at the conclusion
of the Kaffir War. The Orange River Territory was recognised
as a separate Republic in 1854.</p>

<p class="ind">It is certainly true that the existence of these Free States
may complicate our relations with the Kaffirs, and possibly
be a source of danger to the security of British dominion in
South Africa. But the latter danger seems very remote.
They possess <i>no</i> portion of the sea coast, and are altogether a
pastoral people, and are engaged in a constant struggle with the
barbarous tribes in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="ind">To retain and protect these territories would have involved
an immense expenditure, and been attended with great difficulties.
Besides, the same question would have speedily
recurred, as these emigrant Boers would have soon gone further
into the interior, and again have asserted their independence.
Our present relations with both these States are very amicable.
When Governor Sir George Grey went to the Cape all these
questions had been finally disposed of.<sup>38</sup></p>

<p class="ind">There seems to be good reason to hope that the apprehensions
of a Kaffir War will not be realised. The Colony is
very prosperous, and is beginning to export wool in large
quantities. The new legislature appears to be disposed to act
harmoniously with the Governor, and to be actuated by a spirit
of loyalty and attachment to this country. What they most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.202" id="pageiii.202"></a>[page&nbsp;202]</span>
want is a supply of European settlers, which it is to be
hoped that the soldiers of the German and Swiss Legions
will give them.</p>

connected with politics, there have been during the reigns of

<span class="rightnote">LORD GRANVILLE'S MISSION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Moscow</span>, <i>30th August 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Granville presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs, according to your Majesty's desire, to submit to your
Majesty the impressions which he has received during the
short time of his stay in this country.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE CZAR ALEXANDER</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Granville's conversation with the Emperor of Russia,
and what he has heard from various reliable sources, have
led him to the following conclusions respecting His Imperial
Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">He is handsome, but thinner and graver than when he was in
England. When speaking with energy to Lord Granville his
manner seemed to be rather an imitation of some one else than
his own, and he did not look Lord Granville in the face. His
usual manner is singularly gentle and pleasing. He does not
give the idea of having much strength either of intellect or of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.204" id="pageiii.204"></a>[page&nbsp;204]</span>
character, but looks intelligent and amiable. Although the
education of a C&aelig;sarwitch must be subject to pernicious
influences, the present Emperor has had advantages which
those in his position have not usually had. The Emperor
Nicholas came to the throne without having had the confidences
of his predecessor. He initiated his son into everything
that was going on, while others who knew the good-nature of
the Grand Duke Alexander's character, told him that which
they did not tell his father. He was supposed to have different
tastes from the late Emperor, but, since the death of the latter,
he has liked the late Emperor's favourite residence which he
himself had formerly disliked, he has taken to all the military
pursuits of his father, and is said to have shown undignified
haste in issuing regulations about, and in appearing in, new
uniforms. He is liked by those who surround him, but is
blamed for not having those habits of punctuality and of quick
decision in business which characterised the late Emperor.</p>

<p class="ind">There is still much talk of stimulants to be applied by His
Imperial Majesty to commerce and to the development of the
resources of the country.... There are persons, however, here
well qualified to judge, who doubt whether much more will
be performed than has formerly been done, after brilliant
promises at the beginning of a reign. His Imperial Majesty is
not supposed to have that power of will which will enable him
to deal with the mass of corruption which pervades every class
in this country. The Empress,<a id="footnotetagXXV41" name="footnotetagXXV41"></a><a href="#footnoteXXV41"><sup>41</sup></a> a woman of sense and ability,
is believed to have great influence with her husband when he is
with her, but he is generally guided by the person who speaks
last to him before he acts&mdash;and His Imperial Majesty has not
the talent of surrounding himself with able men. His Ministers
certainly do not appear to be men of that remarkable intellect
as have been usually supposed to be employed by the Court
of St Petersburg. Count Orloff is stated to have but little
influence, and to have lost his former activity. Prince Gortschakoff
is clever in society, of easy conversation and some
smartness in repartee. He is vain, a great talker, and indiscreet.
It is difficult to keep him to the point. He flies about
from one thing to another, and he is so loose in his talk, that
the repetition of isolated phrases might lead to impressions of
his meaning, which would not be correct....</p>

<p class="ind">The Serf Question is admitted by all to be of a very difficult
character, and will become more so as the wealth of the country
increases. Indeed when that state of things occurs, it is more
than likely that popular movements will take place, and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.205" id="pageiii.205"></a>[page&nbsp;205]</span>
frightful to consider the immediate results of a revolution in a
country organised as this is at present. No country in Europe
will furnish so fair a chance of success to Socialism. The reins
of Government were held so tight during the last reign, that even
the relaxation which now exists is not altogether without danger.</p>
<span class="rightnote">CORONATION OF THE CZAR</span>
<p class="ind">The preparations for the Coronation are on an immense scale.
The present estimate of the expenses is &pound;1,000,000; the last
Coronation cost half that sum; the Coronation of Alexander,
&pound;150,000; while that of the Emperor Paul did not exceed
&pound;50,000. The military household of the present Emperor
consists of one hundred and twenty generals&mdash;that of Nicholas,
at the beginning of his reign, consisted of twenty.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty is spoken of by the Emperor and by the Society
here with the greatest respect. Lord and Lady Granville have
met with nothing but remarkable civility from all classes.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Granville has had great pleasure in seeing His Royal
Highness Prince Frederick William of Prussia in such good
health and spirits. His only anxiety was an interval of fourteen
days during which His Royal Highness did not hear from
England. That anxiety has been relieved by a letter received
to-day. Lord Granville ventures to request your Majesty to
present his respectful remembrances to the Princess Royal with
his congratulations at Her Royal Highness's complete recovery.
Lord Granville begs to advise Her Royal Highness, when residing
abroad, not to engage a Russian maid. Lady Wodehouse
found hers eating the contents of a pot on her dressing-table&mdash;it
happened to be castor oil pomatum for the hair.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Granville has been requested to convey to your Majesty
and to His Royal Highness Prince Albert the Prince of Nassau's
expressions of devotion and respect. The atmosphere
in which His Highness at present resides does not appear to
have had much influence on His Highness's opinions.</p>

Ripon; and that Dr Trench<sup>44</sup> be appointed Dean of Westminster
with the condition that he is not to receive any fees or
emoluments arising out of appointments of Knights of the Bath.</p>

<p class="ind">Dr Trench is a man of the world and of literature, and would
in those respects be well suited to be Dean of Westminster, and
if his tendencies are, as some persons suppose, rather towards
High Church opinions, his position as Dean would not afford
him any particular means of making those opinions prevail;
while his appointment would show that the patronage of the
Crown was not flowing exclusively in one direction.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Cousin</span>,&mdash;This morning the reply from Baden
reached me, and I hasten to inform you at once of the purport
of it, embodied in a very excellent letter written by my sister
Mary, who <i>declines</i> the proposal made to her on the part of the
King of Sardinia, for some very excellent and weighty reasons.<sup>46</sup></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.207" id="pageiii.207"></a>[page&nbsp;207]</span>

<p class="ind">I must confess that I fully agree with her in the view she has
taken, and, I can say with truth, that I think her decision is a
very judicious and very correct one, and I am not at all sorry
she has come to it. As I know that Clarendon was very anxious
to have an early reply, I have in the first instance sent Mary's
letter on to him, and have requested him, after perusing it, to
send it on to you, and I hope you will not think that I have
been wanting in respect to you in so doing. With many
thanks to you for your great kindness in having left the decision
of this weighty matter entirely in our hands, I beg to remain,
my dear Cousin, your most dutiful Cousin,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">George</span>.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 46: The King had, in January 1855, lost his consort, Queen Marie Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de, daughter of
the Archduke R&eacute;nier of Austria. Lord Clarendon wrote to Baron Marochetti:&mdash;...</p>

<p class="note1">"The Queen's first care was for the happiness of Princess Mary, and it was the wish of
Her Majesty and of Her Majesty's Government that the decision should be left to the
unbiassed judgment of Her Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="note1">"Princess Mary, having maturely weighed the matter in all its different bearings, has
come to the conclusion that it is her duty as regards both the King of Sardinia and herself
to decline the offer, which you were empowered to make on the part of His Majesty.</p>

<p class="note1">"Princess Mary fully appreciates the many excellent and noble qualities of the King.
She does not doubt that in him individually she would be happy, and she thinks that the
alliance would be popular in England; but Her Royal Highness feels that as the Protestant
Queen of Sardinia she must be in a false position, and that a wife can never find herself
thus placed without injury to her husband.</p>

<p class="note1">"Princess Mary is deeply attached to her religion, which is the first consideration in
this world, and in the free and undisturbed exercise of that religion, however much it
might be sanctioned by the King, and supported by His Majesty's Government, she
feels that she would be the object of constant suspicion, that her motives would be liable
to misconstruction, and that the King would be exposed to grave embarrassments, which
time would only serve to increase.</p>

<p class="note1">"I am not surprised at this decision, which, from my knowledge of Princess Mary's
profound religious feeling, I rather led you to anticipate; but I am bound to say that
with reference to her religion, and with reference to that alone, Her Royal Highness has,
in my opinion, decided with wisdom and foresight.</p>

<p class="note1">"I am convinced, however, that in renouncing upon conscientious grounds the brilliant
position which has been offered to her, of which she fully appreciated the advantages,
Princess Mary can only have added to the respect which the King already feels for the
noble and elevated character of Her Royal Highness."

The Russians, however, delayed the stipulated evacuation in an unwarrantable manner.
Ismail also was included within the portion of Bessarabia to be ceded to Turkey, but,
instead of surrendering it intact, the Russians destroyed its fortifications; they also laid
claim to Serpent's Island at the mouth of the Danube, which was within the ceded portion,
and of Bolgrad, the future ownership of which was, owing to the inaccuracies of maps,
in dispute. The English Government sent a fleet to the Black Sea to enforce the obligations

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Lady Hardinge</span>,&mdash;Where can I find words to
express to you our <i>deep heartfelt</i> sorrow at the sad and totally
unexpected news conveyed to us by telegraph yesterday.<sup>52</sup></p>

<p class="ind">My first thought was for you, dear Lady Hardinge, whose
whole existence was so completely bound up in <i>his</i>, that this
blow must be awful indeed. We feel <i>truly</i> and sincerely what
we, and the country, have lost in your dear, high-minded,
noble husband, whose <i>only</i> thought was <i>his duty</i>. A more
loyal, devoted, fearless public servant the Crown never possessed.
His loss to <i>me</i> is one of those which in our times is
quite <i>irreparable</i>. Added to all this we have ever had <i>such</i>
a true affection and personal friendship for dear Lord Hardinge,
and know how warmly these feelings were requited. <i>All</i>
who had the pleasure of knowing him must ever remember
his benevolent smile and kind eye.</p>

<p class="ind">But I speak of ourselves and of what we have lost, when
I <i>ought</i> only to express <i>our</i> sympathy with <i>you</i>, in your
present
overwhelming loss, but I could not restrain my pen, and the
expression of our feelings may perhaps be soothing to your
bleeding heart.</p>

<p class="ind">Most truly also do we sympathise with your children.</p>

<p class="ind">Pray do not think of answering this yourself, but let us
hear through your son or daughter how you are. Ever, dear
Lady Hardinge, with the sincerest regard and truest sympathy,
yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;Since your kind letter of the 2nd
I have not had any communications from you. I can well
understand that it grieves you to leave the Highlands. It
is not a great proof of the happiness of human kind, that all
love to be elsewhere than at the place where their real residence
is, notwithstanding all songs of home sweet home, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.211" id="pageiii.211"></a>[page&nbsp;211]</span>
I plead quite guilty to this, though I used to be much attached
to my old home at Coburg and to Claremont. That the
weather should have been unfavourable is a great pity; here
we have had a most beautiful and mild weather till the 8th,
when a severe thunderstorm put an end to it.</p>

<p class="ind">Poor Lord Hardinge! I believe after all, though all these
people pretend <i>not</i> to mind it, that the Press killed him. I
once told Lady Maryborough and the late Duchess of Wellington
that it was fortunate the Duke cared so little for the Press.
"Care little," they said; "why, nothing annoys and irritates
him more." I find it natural; doing one's best, working
with all one's nerves, and to be abused for it, is not pleasant.</p>

<p class="ind">To explain the real state of dear Charlotte's affair I enclose
the only copy of my letter which exists, and pray you kindly
to send it me back. My object is and was that Charlotte
should decide as <i>she</i> likes it, and uninfluenced by what I might
prefer. <i>I</i> should <i>prefer</i> Pedro, that I confess, but the
Archduke<sup>53</sup>
has made a favourable impression on Charlotte; I
saw that long before any question of engagement had taken
place. The Archduke is out at sea, and nothing can well be
heard before the 25th of this month. If the thing takes
place the Emperor ought to put him at the head of Venice;
he is well calculated for it.</p>

<p class="ind">I am going on the 15th to Ardenne for a week. I have
been since that revolution of 1848 kept away from it almost
entirely, compared to former days. And now, with my best
love to Albert, I must end, remaining ever, my dearest Victoria,
your truly devoted and only Uncle,</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;I am truly thankful for your kind
letter and the very confidential enclosure which I return, and
which has interested us both very much, and is truly kind and
paternal. I <i>still hope</i> by your letter that Charlotte has not
finally made up her mind&mdash;as we both feel so strongly convinced
of the immense superiority of Pedro over any other
young Prince even <i>dans les relations journalistes</i>, besides which
the position is so infinitely preferable. The Austrian society
is <i>m&eacute;disante</i> and profligate and worthless&mdash;and the Italian
possessions very shaky. Pedro is full of resource&mdash;fond of
music, fond of drawing, of languages, of natural history, and
literature, in all of which Charlotte would suit him, and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.212" id="pageiii.212"></a>[page&nbsp;212]</span>
be a <i>real</i> benefit to the country. If Charlotte asked <i>me</i>, I
should not hesitate a moment, as I would give any of my
own daughters to him were he not a Catholic; and if Charlotte
consulted her friend Vicky I know what <i>her</i> answer would
be as she is so very fond of Pedro.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>14th.</i>&mdash;I could not finish last night, and so continue to-day.
I shall be most anxious to hear from you about Charlotte,
when a <i>final</i> decision has been taken.</p>

the country in the <i>most</i> brilliant beauty&mdash;but <i>not</i> the bracing
weather which did one so much good; yesterday and to-day
it is <i>quite</i> warm and relaxing. Albert has continued to have
wonderful sport; not only has he killed seven more stags

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">MILITARY EFFICIENCY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>9th November 1856</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Panmure's two boxes of the
4th. She is glad to hear that the Military and the Defence
Committees of the Cabinet are to be reassembled. The
absence of all plans for our defences is a great evil, and hardly
credible. There should exist a well-considered general scheme
for each place supported by a detailed argument; this when
approved by the Government, should be sanctioned and
signed by the Sovereign, and not deviated from except upon
resubmission and full explanation of the causes which render
such deviation necessary; no special work should be undertaken
which does not realise part of this general scheme.
The Queen trusts that Lord Panmure will succeed in effecting
this.</p>

<p class="ind">It is very much to be regretted that so few of the soldiers
of the German Legion should have accepted the liberal terms
of the Government. Those should, however, be made to
sail soon.</p>

<p class="ind">The returns of the different Departments for the last quarter
show a lamentable deficiency in small arms. Fifty-two
thousand three hundred and twenty-two for the whole of
the United Kingdom is a sadly small reserve to have in store;
we should never be short of 500,000. The Queen was struck
also with the little work done at Enfield. It appears that
during the whole quarter this new and extensive establishment
has completed only three muskets!</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to some of the barracks, the tenders have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.213" id="pageiii.213"></a>[page&nbsp;213]</span>
even yet been accepted, although the year is nearly drawing
to a close. The Queen hopes soon to receive the returns for
the Fortification Department, which is fully two months in
arrear....</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the list for the Bath, the Queen is somewhat
startled by the large number. Before sanctioning it, she
thinks it right to ask for an explanation of the services of the
officers, and the reasons for which they are selected for the
honour. She returns the list for that purpose to Lord Panmure,
who will perhaps cause the statement to be attached
to each name. This, of course, does not apply to the foreigners.
Amongst the Sardinians, however, the Queen observes the
absence of the names of the Military Commissioners attached
first to Lord Raglan and afterwards to General Simpson.
The first was a Count Revel, who has frequently applied for
the honour, and the Queen thinks ought to have it.</p>

that Sardinia has not yet formed her decision. We cannot therefore foresee in what sense
the majority will pronounce, and it is evident to us that the reunion will realise the object
desired, that of bringing on a decision which cannot be questioned by any one, seeing
that it will have been obtained by the concurrence of the Representatives of all the
Powers."

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 55: Besides the complications arising out of the procrastination of Russia, in carrying out
the Treaty of Paris, an international difficulty had lately arisen in Switzerland. A rising,
professedly in defence of the hereditary interests of the King of Prussia, took place in
the Canton of Neuch&acirc;tel, but was suppressed, and some of the insurgents taken prisoners
by the Republican Government. The King of Prussia virtually expressed his approval
of the movement by claiming the liberation of the prisoners, and his action was, to some
extent, countenanced by the French Emperor. The matter was finally adjusted in 1857.

does not seem to require an answer at present.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon had a conversation of two hours this morning
with M. de Persigny, who fought all his battles o'er again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.215" id="pageiii.215"></a>[page&nbsp;215]</span>
but did not say much beyond what Lord Cowley had reported.
He is quite sure that the Emperor is as staunch as ever to
the Alliance, and that he believes all his own personal interests
as well as those of France are bound up with England. He
said, too, that the Empress was not the least taken in by the
flatteries of Russia, which she estimates at their <i>juste valeur</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">M. de Persigny seems to have performed an act of painful
duty and rather of true devotion, by giving the Empress some
advice about her own conduct and the fate she was preparing
for herself if she was not more properly mindful of her position
and the obligations it entails. Lord Clarendon has seldom
heard anything more eloquent or more touching than the
language of M. de Persigny in describing what he said to the
Empress, who appears to have taken it in the best part, and
to have begun acting upon the advice the next day. M. de
Persigny has no doubt that Count Walewski will soon be
removed from his present office, and will be <i>promoted to St.
Petersburg</i>, but Lord Clarendon will wait to believe this until
it is a <i>fait accompli</i>, as it is more likely than not that when
M. de Persigny is no longer on the spot to urge the Emperor,
Count Walewski will resume his influence.</p>

<p class="ind">Count Walewski's despatch made a very unfavourable impression
upon the Cabinet, who were of opinion that upon
such an invitation and such slender assurances respecting the
course that Sardinia might take, we ought not to give up our
solid and often repeated objections to reassembling the Congress&mdash;at
all events it was considered that we ought to have a
positive answer from Turin before we gave a final answer....</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that Sir Alexander Cockburn<sup>56</sup>
accepts the office of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, but
expresses a strong wish not altogether to be shut out from
Parliamentary functions. His health, which has frequently
interfered with his attendance in the House of Commons,
makes him feel uncertain as to the future, and he is not desirous
of being immediately placed in the House of Lords, but he
would be glad to be allowed to look forward to such a favour
from your Majesty at some future time if he should find his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.216" id="pageiii.216"></a>[page&nbsp;216]</span>
health stand sufficiently good to give him a fair prospect of
being useful in the House of Lords. He says that with the
Baronetcy of an uncle he will succeed to an estate of &pound;5,000 a
year, independent of what he has realised by his own professional
exertions; and that consequently there would be a
provision for a Peerage. Viscount Palmerston begs to submit
for your Majesty's gracious approval that such a prospect
might be held out to Sir Alexander Cockburn. The Chancellor
and Lord Lansdowne and Lord Granville concur with Viscount
Palmerston in thinking that much public advantage would
arise from the presence of both Sir Alexander Cockburn, and of
the Master of the Rolls,<sup>57</sup> in the House of Lords, and there are
numerous precedents for the Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, and for the Master of the Rolls being Peers of Parliament.<sup>58</sup>
Their judicial duties would no doubt prevent them
from sitting in the morning on appeal cases, but their presence
in the evening in debates in which the opinions and learning
of men holding high positions in the legal profession would be
required, could not fail to be of great public advantage. Of
course any expectation to be held out to Sir Alexander Cockburn
would for the present be a confidential and private
communication to himself....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Palmerston's explanation of Lord Panmure's object
in proposing the appointment of a Director-General of Education
of the Army in the Civil Department of its Government
has but confirmed the Queen's apprehensions as to the effect
of that step, if sanctioned. The Queen has for some time
been expecting the proposal of a well-digested and considered
plan for the education of the officers of the Army, and knows
that the Duke of Cambridge has had such a one elaborated.
Surely, in the absence of any fixed and approved system of
education, it would be most imprudent to establish an Office
for the discharge of certain important functions which are not
yet defined. The Queen must therefore ask that the system
of education to be in future adopted should first be submitted

<span class="rightnote">THE MAHARAJAH DHULEEP SINGH</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>15th December 1856.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has seen the Memorandum which the Maharajah
Dhuleep Singh has sent to the East India Company; she
thinks all he asks very fair and reasonable, and she trusts that
the East India Company will be able to comply with them.
As we are in complete possession since 1849 of the Maharajah's
enormous and splendid Kingdom, the Queen thinks we
ought to do <i>everything</i> (which does not interfere with the
safety of her Indian dominions) to render the position of this
interesting and peculiarly good and amiable Prince as agreeable
as possible, and not to let him have the feeling that he is <i>a
prisoner</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">His being a Christian and completely European (or rather
more English) in his habits and feelings, renders this much
more necessary, and at the same time more easy.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has a very strong feeling that everything should
be done to show respect and kindness towards these poor fallen
Indian Princes, whose Kingdoms we have taken from them,
and who are naturally very sensitive to attention and kindness.</p>

<p class="ind">Amongst all these, however, the Maharajah stands to a
certain degree alone, from his civilisation, and likewise from
his having lost his kingdom when he was a child entirely by
the faults and misdeeds of others.<sup>62</sup></p>

<span class="rightnote">MILITARY EDUCATION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>18th December 1856.</i></p>

<p class="ind">In answer to Lord Palmerston's explanation with regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.220" id="pageiii.220"></a>[page&nbsp;220]</span>
Colonel Lefroy's<sup>63</sup> appointment, the Queen has to say, that if
he is to be made Inspector of Regimental Schools, she has no
objection; but she must protest against his being made <i>Director</i>
of Education for the Army generally. We want a Director-General
of Education very much, but he ought to be
immediately under the Commander-in-Chief, if possible a
General Officer of weight, assisted by a Board of Officers of
the different Arms.</p>

<p class="ind">Education ought to be made one of the essential requisites
of an officer, and the reports on his proficiency ought to go direct
through the proper superior from the bottom to the top, particularly
if selection by merit is to receive a greater application
for the future. If for his military proficiency and moral
discipline, an officer is to be responsible to his Military chief,
but for his mental acquirements to a Civil department, the
unity of the system will be broken and the Army ruined; and
this <i>must</i> be the case if the superintendence of the education
is separated from the Military command.</p>

<p class="ind">The subject of Military Education has, as Lord Palmerston
says, often been discussed in Parliament, which expects that
some sufficient arrangement shall be made for it. But the
mere creation of a place for an officer, however meritorious, to
find him an equivalent for one which has to be reduced, can
hardly be so called, and may even defeat the object itself.
This subject is a most important one, and ought to be
thoroughly examined before acting. The Queen understands
that the Duke of Cambridge has transmitted to Lord Panmure
a complete scheme, which must be now before him. If Lord
Palmerston, Lord Panmure, the Duke of Cambridge, and the
Prince were to meet to consider this scheme, and the whole
question in connection with it, the Queen would feel every
confidence that a satisfactory decision would be arrived at.</p>

artillery officer of considerable scientific attainments. Many years later he was K.C.M.G.

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXVI</h3>


<p>The closing months of 1856 had witnessed the beginning of a
dispute with China, a party of Chinese having boarded the lorcha
<i>Arrow</i>, a vessel registered under a recent ordinance of Hong Kong,
arrested the crew as pirates, and torn down the British flag. The
Captain's right to fly the flag was questionable, for the term of
registry, even if valid in the first instance, which was disputed, had
expired (though the circumstance was unknown to the Chinese
authorities), and the ship's earlier history under the Chinese flag
had been an evil one. But Sir John Bowring, British Plenipotentiary
at Hong Kong, took punitive measures to enforce treaty obligations;
Admiral Seymour destroyed the forts on the river, and
occupied the island and fort of Dutch Folly. In retaliation, the
Chinese Governor Yeh put a price on Bowring's head, and his
assassination, and that of other residents, by poison, was attempted.
The British Government's action, however, was stigmatised as highhanded,
and a resolution censuring them was carried in the Commons,
being moved by Mr Cobden and supported by a coalition of
Conservatives, Peelites, and the Peace Party,&mdash;Lord John Russell
also opposing the Government. In consequence of this vote,
Parliament was dissolved, and at the ensuing election the Peace
Party was scattered to the winds; Bright, Milner Gibson, and
Cobden all losing their seats. Lord Palmerston obtained a triumphant
majority in the new House of Commons, of which Mr J. E.
Denison was elected Speaker in succession to Mr Shaw-Lefevre, now
created Viscount Eversley. At the end of the year an ultimatum
was sent to Governor Yeh, requiring observance of the Treaty of
Nankin, Canton was bombarded, and subsequently occupied by the
English and French troops.</p>

<p>Hostilities with Persia were terminated by a treaty signed at Paris;
the Shah engaging to abstain from interference in Afghanistan, and
to recognise the independence of Herat.</p>

<p>A century had passed since the victory of Clive at Plassey, but the
Afghan disasters and the more recent war with Russia had caused
doubts to arise as to British stability in India, where the native forces
were very large in comparison with the European. Other causes,
among which may be mentioned the legalising of the remarriage of
Hindoo widows, and a supposed intention to coerce the natives into
Christianity, were operating to foment dissatisfaction, while recent
acts of insubordination and symptoms of mutiny had been inadequately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.224" id="pageiii.224"></a>[page&nbsp;224]</span>
repressed; but the immediate visible provocation to mutiny
among the Bengal troops was the use of cartridges said to be treated
with a preparation of the fat of pigs and cows, the use of which was
abhorrent, on religious grounds, both to Hindoos and Mohammedans.
The Governor-General assured the Sepoys by proclamation that no
offence to their religion or injury to their caste was intended; but
on the 10th of May the native portion of the garrison at Meerut
broke out in revolt. The Mutineers proceeded to Delhi, and were
joined by the native troops there; they established as Emperor the
octogenarian King, a man of unscrupulous character, who had been
living under British protection.</p>

<p>Great cruelties were practised on the European population of all
ages and both sexes, at Lucknow, Allahabad, and especially Cawnpore;
by the end of June, the Sepoys had mutinied at twenty-two
stations&mdash;the districts chiefly affected being Bengal, the North-West
Provinces, and Oudh. To cope with this state of things, a large body
of British soldiers on their way to China were diverted by Lord Elgin
to India, and a force of 40,000 men was despatched from England
round the Cape; while Sir Colin Campbell was sent out as Commander-in-Chief.
Meanwhile reinforcements had been drawn from the
Punjab, which had remained loyal. Lucknow was for a long time
besieged by the rebels, and Sir Henry Lawrence, its gallant defender,
killed. The garrison was reinforced on the 25th of September by
General Havelock; but the non-combatants could not be extricated
from their perilous position till November, when the Garrison was
relieved by Sir Colin Campbell. Delhi was taken in the course
of September, but a considerable period elapsed before the rebellion
was finally suppressed. Summary vengeance was inflicted on the
Sepoy rebels, which gave rise to some criticism of our troops for
inhumanity; but Lord Canning, the Governor-General, was no less
severely blamed for his clemency; and the general verdict was in
favour of the measures adopted by the military and civilian officers,
whose zeal and capacity suppressed the Mutiny.</p>

<p>Before the Dissolution of Parliament, Mr Gladstone and Mr
Disraeli had joined in an attack on the budget of Sir George Lewis,
and the Peelite ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer seemed for the
moment disposed definitely to return to the Conservative party.
To the Divorce Bill, the chief legislative result of the second Session,
Mr Gladstone gave a persistent and unyielding opposition: but it
passed the Commons by large majorities; a Bill for the removal of
Jewish disabilities was much debated, but not carried. In August,
another visit, this time of a private character, was paid by the
Emperor and Empress of the French to the Queen at Osborne. In
the middle of November a series of commercial disasters of great
magnitude took place. The Government, as in 1847, authorised the
infringement for a time of the Bank Charter Act, and a third session
was held to pass an Act of Indemnity.</p>

<p class="ind">The despatches from Sir George Grey<sup>1</sup> which the Queen
returns are most interesting. The two chief objects to accomplish
appear to be the bringing the Kaffirs in British Kaffraria
within the pale of the law, so that they may know the blessings
of it&mdash;and the re-absorption, if possible, of the Orange River
Free State. To both these objects the efforts of the Government
should be steadily directed.</p>

<span class="rightnote">HOME AND FOREIGN POLICY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Broadlands</span>, <i>13th January 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and he and Lady Palmerston will have the honour of
waiting upon your Majesty as soon as he is able to move. He
is, however, at present on crutches, and can hardly expect to
be in marching order for some few days to come. With regard
to the matters that are likely to be discussed when Parliament
meets, Viscount Palmerston would beg to submit that the one
which has for some months past occupied the attention of all
Europe, namely, the execution of the Treaty of Paris, has been
settled in a manner satisfactory to all parties; and this is not
only a great relief to the Government, but is also a security
for the continuance of the Anglo-French Alliance, which would
have been greatly endangered by the discussions and explanations
that might otherwise have been forced on.</p>

<p class="ind">The various questions of difference between your Majesty's
Government, and that of the United States, have also been
settled, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries
are about to be replaced upon their usual footing. This result
will have given great satisfaction to the commercial and manufacturing
interests.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.226" id="pageiii.226"></a>[page&nbsp;226]</span>

<p class="ind">Some discussion will take place as to the Expedition to the
coast of Persia, and some persons will, of course, find fault with
the whole policy pursued on that matter; but people in general
will understand that Herat is an advanced post of attack against
British India, and that whatever belongs nominally to Persia
must be considered as belonging practically to Russia, whenever
Russia may want to use it for her own purposes.</p>

<p class="ind">The outbreak of hostilities at Canton<a id="footnotetagXXVI2" name="footnotetagXXVI2"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI2"><sup>2</sup></a> was the result of the
decision of your Majesty's officers on the spot, and not the consequence
of orders from home. The first responsibility must
therefore rest with the local authorities, but Viscount Palmerston
cannot doubt that the Government will be deemed to
have acted right in advising your Majesty to approve the proceedings,
and to direct measures for obtaining from the Chinese
Government concessions which are indispensable for the maintenance
of friendly relations between China and the Governments
of Europe.</p>

<p class="ind">Of domestic questions, that which will probably be the most
agitated will be a large and immediate diminution of the
Income Tax; but any such diminution would disturb the
financial arrangements of the country, and it is to be hoped
that Parliament will adopt the scheme which will be proposed
by Sir G. C. Lewis, by which the Income Tax would be made
equal in each of the next three years, the amount now fixed
by Law for 1857 being diminished, but the amount now
fixed by Law for 1858 and 1859 being increased....</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston hears from persons likely to know, that
the Conservative Party are not more united than they were last
Session. That Mr Disraeli and the great bulk of his nominal
followers are far from being on good terms together, and that
there is no immediate junction to be expected between Mr
Disraeli and Mr Gladstone.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Mr Cobden has given it to be understood that he wishes at
the next General Election to retire from the West Riding of
Yorkshire. The real fact being that the line he took about the
late war has made him so unpopular with his constituents that
he would probably not be returned again.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston has heard privately and confidentially
that Lord John Russell wrote some little time ago to the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.227" id="pageiii.227"></a>[page&nbsp;227]</span>
of Bedford to say that it had been intimated to him that an
offer would be made to him if he were disposed to accept it, to
go to the House of Lords and to become there the Leader of
the Government. In case your Majesty may have heard this
report, Viscount Palmerston thinks it right to say that no such
communication to Lord John Russell was ever authorised by
him, nor has been, so far as he is aware, ever made, and in truth
Viscount Palmerston must candidly say that in the present
state of public opinion about the course which Lord John has
on several occasions pursued, he is not inclined to think that
his accession to the Government would give the Government
any additional strength.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen would wish to know before she approves of the
appointment of Mr Alford, of Quebec Chapel, to the head
Deanery of Canterbury, whether he is a very Low Churchman,
as Lord Palmerston will remember that he agreed in her
observation after the appointment of several of the Bishops,
that it would be advisable to choose those who were of moderate
opinions&mdash;not leaning too much to either side. Extreme
opinions lead to mischief in the end, and produce much discord
in the Church, which it would be advisable to avoid.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the Garter, which the Duke of Norfolk has
declined, she approves of its being offered to the Duke of
Portland.<sup>6</sup> She thinks that the one now vacant by the death
of poor Lord Ellesmere<sup>7</sup> might most properly be bestowed on
Lord Granville&mdash;he is Lord President and Leader of the House
of Lords, and acquitted himself admirably in his difficult
mission as Ambassador to the Emperor of Russia's Coronation.</p>

<p class="ind">Should Lord Palmerston agree in this view he might at once
mention it to Lord Granville.</p>

Viscount Palmerston can scarcely bring himself to believe that
the House of Commons will be so fickle as suddenly and without
reason to turn round upon the Government, and after having
given them last Session and this Session large majorities on
important questions, put them in a minority on what Mr Disraeli
last night in a few words said on the motion for adjournment
described as a Vote of Censure. With regard, however,
to the question put by your Majesty as to what would be the
course pursued by the Government in the event of a defeat,
Viscount Palmerston could hardly answer it without deliberation
with his colleagues. His own firm belief is that the present
Government has the confidence of the country in a greater
degree than any other Government that could now be formed
would have, and that consequently upon a Dissolution of
Parliament, a House of Commons would be returned more
favourable to the Government than the present. Whether the
state of business as connected with votes of supply and the
Mutiny Act would admit of a Dissolution, supposing such a
measure to be sanctioned by your Majesty, would remain to be
enquired into; but Viscount Palmerston believes that there
would be no insurmountable difficulty on that score. He will
have the honour of waiting upon your Majesty at a little before
three to-morrow.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>18th March 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Viscount Palmerston begs to state that the Speaker
has chosen the title of Eversley, the name of a small place near
his residence<sup>13</sup> in Hampshire, all the large towns in the county
having already been adopted as titles for Peers. The ordinary
course would be that your Majesty should make him
a Baron, and that is the course which was followed in the cases
of Mr Abbot made Lord Colchester, and Mr Abercromby made
Lord Dunfermline; but in the case of Mr Manners Sutton a
different course was pursued, and he was made Viscount
Canterbury. The present Speaker is very anxious that his
services, which, in fact, have been more meritorious and useful
than those of Mr Manners Sutton, should not appear to be considered
by your Majesty as less deserving of your Majesty's
Royal favour, and as the present Speaker may justly be said
to have been the best who ever filled the chair, Viscount
Palmerston would beg to submit for your Majesty's gracious
approval that he may be created Viscount Eversley. It will
be well at the same time if your Majesty should sanction this
arrangement that a Record should be entered at the Home
Office stating that this act of grace and favour of your Majesty
being founded on the peculiar circumstances of the case, is not
to [be] deemed a precedent for the cases of future Speakers.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canterbury was also made a Grand Cross of the Civil
Order of the Bath; it will be for your Majesty to consider
whether it might not be gracious to follow in all respects on
the present occasion the course which was pursued in the case
of Mr Manners Sutton.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Granville presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs to submit that the Lord Chancellor made the best
statement he has yet done, introducing his Divorce Bill.<sup>15</sup>...
Lord Lyndhurst made a most able speech in favour of the Bill,
but wished it to go further, and give permission to a woman
to sue for a divorce if she was "maliciously deserted" by her
husband.... The Bishop of Oxford pretended that he was
not going to speak at all, in order to secure his following instead
of preceding the Bishop of London; but upon a division being
called he was obliged to speak, and did so with considerable
force and eloquence, but betraying the greatest possible
preparation. The Bishop of London, after showing that

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 15: Before this date a divorce could only be obtained in England by Act of Parliament,
after sentence in the ecclesiastical Court, and (in the case of a husband's application) a
verdict in <i>crim. con.</i> against the adulterer. The present English law was established by
the Bill of 1857, the chief amendment made in Committee being the provision exempting
the clergy from the obligation to marry divorced persons. Bishop Wilberforce opposed
the Bill strenuously, while Archbishop Sumner and Bishop Tait of London supported it.
Sir Richard Bethell, the Attorney-General, piloted the measure most skilfully through
the Commons, in the teeth of the eloquent and persistent opposition of Mr Gladstone,
who, to quote a letter from Lord Palmerston to the Queen, opposed the second reading
"in a speech of two hours and a half, fluent, eloquent, brilliant, full of theological learning
and scriptural research, but fallacious in argument, and with parts inconsistent with
each other."

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to inform your Royal Highness that
I have had a very long and interesting conversation with M. de
Persigny to-day. He told me of the different <i>Utopias</i> which
the Emperor had in his head, of His Majesty's conviction that
England, France, and Russia ought between them to <i>r&eacute;gler les

or any other Power, and of the various little complaints which
His Majesty thought he had against Her Majesty's Government,
and which had been magnified into importance by the
malevolence or the stupidity of the persons who had more or
less the ear of the Emperor.<a id="footnotetagXXVI16" name="footnotetagXXVI16"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p class="ind">M. de Persigny told me also that in a conversation with the
Emperor at which he had taken care that Count Walewski
should be present, he had solemnly warned the Emperor of the
danger he would incur if he swerved the least from the path
of his true interest which was the English Alliance, that all the
Sovereigns who were flattering and cajoling him for their own
purposes looked down upon him as an adventurer, and no
more believed in the stability of his throne, or the duration of
his dynasty, than they did in any other events of which extreme
improbability was the character; whereas the English,
who never condescended to flatter or cajole anybody, but who
looked to the interests of England, were attached to the French
Alliance and to the Sovereign of France because peaceful relations
with that country were of the utmost importance to
England. France was the only country in Europe that could
do England harm, and on the other hand England was the
only country that could injure France&mdash;the late war with
Russia had not the slightest effect upon France except costing
her money, but a war with England would set every party in
France into activity each with its own peculiar objects, but
all of them against the existing order of things&mdash;<i>l'ordre social
serait boulevers&eacute;</i> and the Empire might perish in the convulsion.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR'S VISIT</span>
<p class="ind">The result of this and other conversations appears to be an
earnest desire of the Emperor to come to England on a private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.233" id="pageiii.233"></a>[page&nbsp;233]</span>
visit to the Queen, if possible at Osborne, and at any time
that might be convenient to Her Majesty. M. de Persigny
describes him as being intent upon this project, and as attaching
the utmost importance to it in order to <i>&eacute;clairer</i> his own
ideas, to guide his policy, and to prevent by personal communication
with the Queen, your Royal Highness, and Her
Majesty's Government the dissidences and <i>m&eacute;sintelligences</i>
which the Emperor thinks will arise from the want of such
communications.</p>

<p class="ind">I fear that such a visit would not be very agreeable to
Her Majesty, but in the Emperor's present frame of mind,
and his evident alarm lest it should be thought that the
Alliance has been in any way <i>&eacute;branl&eacute;e</i>, I cannot entertain a
doubt that much good might be done, or, at all events,
that much mischief might be averted by the Emperor being
allowed to pay his respects to Her Majesty in the manner
he proposes.</p>

<p class="ind">I have discussed the matter after the Cabinet this evening
with Lord Palmerston, who takes entirely the same view of
the matter as I have taken the liberty of expressing to your

<span class="rightnote">THE INDIAN MUTINY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>26th June 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Viscount Palmerston is sorry to have received the
accompanying account of the extension of the Mutiny among
the native troops in India, but he has no fear of its results.<sup>20</sup>
The bulk of the European force is stationed on the North-West
Frontier, and is, therefore, within comparatively easy reach
of Delhi, and about six thousand European troops will have
returned to Bombay from Persia. It will, however, seem to be
advisable to send off at once the force amounting to nearly
eight thousand men, now under orders for embarkation for
India; and when the despatches arrive, which will be about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.235" id="pageiii.235"></a>[page&nbsp;235]</span>
the middle of next week, it will be seen whether any further
reinforcements will be required.</p>

<p class="ind">The extent of the Mutiny appears to indicate some deeper
cause than that which was ascribed to the first insubordination.
That cause may be, as some allege, the apprehension
of the Hindoo priests that their religion is in danger by the
progress of civilisation in India, or it may be some hostile
foreign agency.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 20: Alarming accounts of disturbances in India had been received for some weeks past,
but Lord Palmerston failed to grasp the gravity of the situation. Even after the intelligence
reached England of the mutiny of the native regiments at Meerut, on the 10th of
May, and of the horrible massacres of women and children, the Ministry did not fully
realise the peril threatening our Indian possessions.

<p class="ind">The Queen thinks that the persons decorated with the
Victoria Cross might very properly be allowed to bear some
distinctive mark after their name.<sup>21</sup> The warrant instituting
the decoration does not style it "an Order," but merely "a
Naval and Military Decoration" and a distinction; nor is it
properly speaking an order, being not <i>constituted</i>. V.C. would
not do. K.G. means a <i>Knight</i> of the Garter, C.B. a <i>Companion</i>
of the Bath, M.P. a <i>Member</i> of Parliament, M.D. a
<i>Doctor</i> of Medicine, etc., etc., in all cases designating a person.
No one could be called a Victoria Cross. V.C. moreover means
Vice-Chancellor at present. D.V.C. (decorated with the
Victoria Cross) or B.V.C. (Bearer of the Victoria Cross) might
do. The Queen thinks the last the best.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 21: The Victoria Cross had just been instituted by Royal Warrant, and the Queen had,

<span class="rightnote">REINFORCEMENTS FOR INDIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>29th June 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has to acknowledge the receipt of Lord Panmure's
letter of yesterday. She had long been of opinion
that reinforcements waiting to go to India ought not to be
delayed. The moment is certainly a very critical one, and the
additional reinforcements now proposed will be much wanted.
The Queen entirely agrees with Lord Panmure that it will be
good policy to oblige the East India Company to keep permanently
a larger portion of the Royal Army in India than
heretofore. The Empire has nearly doubled itself within the
last twenty years, and the Queen's troops have been kept
at the old establishment. They are the body on whom the
maintenance of that Empire depends, and the Company ought
not to sacrifice the highest interests to love of patronage. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.236" id="pageiii.236"></a>[page&nbsp;236]</span>
Queen hopes that the new reinforcements will be sent out in
their Brigade organisation, and not as detached regiments;
good Commanding Officers knowing their troops will be of the
highest importance next to the troops themselves.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must ask that the troops by whom we shall be
diminished at home by the transfer of so many regiments to
the Company should be forthwith replaced by an increase of
the establishment up to the number voted by Parliament, and
for which the estimates have been taken, else we denude ourselves
altogether to a degree dangerous to our own safety at
home, and incapable of meeting a sudden emergency, which,
as the present example shows, may come upon us at any
moment. If we had not reduced in such a hurry this spring,
we should now have all the men wanted!</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes Lord Panmure to communicate this
letter to Lord Palmerston. The accounts in to-day's papers
from India are most distressing.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Panmure's letter of yesterday.
She has sanctioned the going of four Regiments to the East
Indies. With regard to the reduction of the garrison of Malta
to four Regiments, she hopes the Government will well consider
whether this will not reduce this valuable and exposed
spot to a state of insecurity.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is sorry to find Lord Panmure still objecting
to a proper Brigade system, without which no army in the
world can be efficient. We want General Officers, and cannot
train them unless we employ them on military duty, not on
clerks' duty in district or colony, but in the command of
troops. The detachment of Regiments is no reason for having
no system, and the country will not pay for General Officers
whose employment is not part of a system; our Army is then
deprived of its efficiency by the refusal to adopt a system on
the part of the Government.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Calcutta</span>, <i>4th July 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and although unable to give to your Majesty the complete
details of the capture of Delhi, and of the defeat of the rebels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.237" id="pageiii.237"></a>[page&nbsp;237]</span>
in that city,<a id="footnotetagXXVI22" name="footnotetagXXVI22"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI22"><sup>22</sup></a> as he has long desired to do, he can at least
announce to your Majesty that the city is in the possession
of the British troops, under Major-General Sir Henry Barnard;
and that nothing remains in the hands of the insurgents
except the Palace or Fort, in which they have all taken
refuge. This was the state of things on the 13th and 14th
of June, the latest day of which any certain accounts have
been received from Delhi; but nothing was likely to interfere
with the completion of the capture within forty-eight
hours.</p>

<p class="ind">This event has been long and anxiously awaited, and the
time which has elapsed has cost England and India very dear.
Many precious lives have been lost, and much heartrending
suffering has been endured, for which there can be no compensation.
The reputation of England's power, too, has had a rude
shake; and nothing but a long-continued manifestation of
her might before the eyes of the whole Indian Empire, evinced
by the presence of such an English force as shall make the
thought of oppositon hopeless, will re-establish confidence in
her strength.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning much fears that there are parts of India
where, until this is done, a complete return to peace and
order will not be effected. Wherever the little band of English
soldiers&mdash;little when compared with the stretch of country
over which they have to operate&mdash;which Lord Canning has
at his disposal has shown itself, the effect has been instantaneous.</p>

<p class="ind">Except at Delhi, there has scarcely been an attempt at
resistance to an European soldier, and the march of the smallest
detachments has preserved order right and left of the roads.
The same has been the case in large cities, such as Benares,
Patna, and others; all going to prove that little more than
the presence of English troops is needed to ensure peace.
On the other hand, where such troops are known not to be
within reach, anarchy and violence, when once let loose,
continue unrestrained; and, until further additions are made
to the English regiments in the disturbed districts, this state
of things will not only continue, but extend itself. The
fall of Delhi will act to some degree as a check; but where
rapine and outrage have raged uncontrolled, even for a few
hours, it is to be feared that nothing but the actual presence
of force will bring the country into order.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.238" id="pageiii.238"></a>[page&nbsp;238]</span>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning rejoices to say that to-day the first Regiment
of your Majesty's Forces destined for China has entered the
Hooghly. Lord Canning did not scruple, knowing how much
was at stake, earnestly to press Lord Elgin to allow those
forces to be turned aside to India before proceeding to the
support of your Majesty's Plenipotentiary in China;<a id="footnotetagXXVI23" name="footnotetagXXVI23"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI23"><sup>23</sup></a> and
to this, so far as regards the first two Regiments, Lord Elgin
readily assented. From what Lord Canning has ventured to
state above, your Majesty will easily understand the satisfaction
with which each new arrival of an English transport
in Calcutta is regarded by him.</p>

<p class="ind">As yet no military operations south of Delhi have been
undertaken. Next week, however, a column composed of
your Majesty's 64th and 78th (Highland) Regiments will
reach Cawnpore<sup>24</sup> and Lucknow, in the neighbourhood of
which it is probable that an opportunity will offer of striking
a decisive blow at the band of rebels which, after that in
Delhi, is the strongest and most compact. But Lord Canning
greatly doubts whether they will await the onset. Unfortunately,
they may run away from the English troops, and yet
prove very formidable to any who are weaker than themselves&mdash;whether
Indians or unarmed Europeans.</p>
<span class="rightnote">GRAVE ANXIETY</span>
<p class="ind">Your Majesty is aware that in the critical condition of
affairs which now exists, Lord Canning has felt himself compelled
to adopt the measure of placing the King of Oudh in
confinement in Fort William, in consequence of the use made
of his name by those who have been busy tampering with the
Sepoys; and of the intrigues which there is good reason to
believe that the Minister of the King, who is also in the Fort,
has carried on in his master's name.<sup>25</sup> The King has been,
and will continue to be, treated with every mark of respect
and indulgence which is compatible with his position, so long
as it may be necessary that he should be retained in the Fort.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning earnestly hopes that your Majesty and the
Prince are in the enjoyment of good health, and prays your
Majesty to be graciously pleased to accept the expression of
his sincere devotion and dutiful attachment.</p>

<a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagXXVI22">Footnote 22:</a> After the outbreak at Meerut in May, the fugitive Sepoys fled to Delhi, and endeavoured
to capture the magazine, which, however, was exploded by British soldiers.
Delhi was not captured until September (see <i>post</i>, <a href="#pageiii.249" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 249</a>). On the 11th of July, the
Government received intelligence of the spread of the Mutiny throughout Bengal, and
the resulting diminution of the Indian Army.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 24: On the 4th of June, two native regiments had mutinied at Cawnpore, and the English
residents, under General Sir Hugh Wheeler, were besieged. After many deaths and much
privation, the garrison were induced by the perfidy of Nana Sahib, who had caused the
Cawnpore rising, to surrender, on condition of their lives being spared. On the 27th of
June, not suspecting their impending fate, the enfeebled garrison, or what was left of it,
gave themselves up. The men were killed, the women and children being first enslaved
and afterwards massacred. On the 16th of July, General Havelock defeated Nana
Sahib at Cawnpore, the city was occupied by the English, and a sanguinary, but well-merited,
retribution exacted.</p>

arrest took place early in June at his residence at Garden Beach.

<span class="rightnote">DEBATE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>27th July 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that Mr Disraeli this afternoon,
in a speech of three hours, made his Motion on the state of
India. His Motion was ostensibly for two papers, one of
which does not exist, at least in the possession of the Government,
and the other of which ought not to be made public,
as it relates to the arrangements for defending India against
external attack. He represented the disturbances in India
as a national revolt, and not as a mere military mutiny; and
he enumerated various causes which in his opinion accounted,
for and justified this general revolt. Some of these causes
were various measures of improved civilisation which from
time to time during the last ten years the Indian Government
had been urged by Parliament to take. Mr Vernon Smith
followed, and in a very able speech answered in great detail
Mr Disraeli's allegations. Sir Erskine Perry,<sup>26</sup> who evidently
had furnished Mr Disraeli with much of his mistaken assertions,
supported his views. Mr Campbell, Member for Weymouth,
who had been many years in India, showed the fallacy
of Mr Disraeli's arguments, and the groundlessness of many
of his assertions. Mr Whiteside supported the Motion. Lord
John Russell, who had after Mr Disraeli's speech communicated
with the Government, expressed his disapprobation of Mr Disraeli's
speech, and moved as an Amendment an Address
to your Majesty expressing the assurance of the support
of the House for measures to suppress the present disturbances,
and their co-operation with your Majesty in measures for the
permanent establishment of tranquillity and contentment
in India.<sup>27</sup> Mr Mangles, the Chairman of the Directors, replied
at much length, and very conclusively to Mr Disraeli's
speech. Mr Liddell, with much simplicity, asked the Speaker
to tell him how he should vote, but approved entirely of
Lord John Russell's address. Mr Ayrton moved an adjournment
of the Debate, which was negatived by 203 to 79. Mr
Hadfield then shortly stated in his provincial dialect that
"we can never keep our 'old upon Hindia by the Force of
Harms." Mr Disraeli then made an animated reply to the
speeches against him, but in a manner almost too animated
for the occasion. Mr Thomas Baring set Mr Disraeli right,
but in rather strong terms, about some proceedings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.240" id="pageiii.240"></a>[page&nbsp;240]</span>
Committee on Indian Affairs in 1853, with regard to which
Mr Disraeli's memory had proved untrustworthy. Viscount
Palmerston shortly made some observations on the Motion
and the speech which had introduced it; and the Motion was
then negatived without a division, and the Address was
unanimously carried.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 26: Chief Justice of Bombay 1847-1852, and M.P. for Devonport 1854-1859.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 27: "One of those dry constitutional platitudes," said Mr Disraeli in reply, "which in
a moment of difficulty the noble lord pulls out of the dusty pigeon-holes of his mind, and
shakes in the perplexed face of the baffled House of Commons." Mr Disraeli was
admittedly much annoyed by the statesmanlike intervention of Lord John.

when <i>he is away</i>; it seems as if the whole life of the house
and home were gone, when he is away!</p>

<p class="ind">We do all we can to <i>f&ecirc;ter</i> in our very <i>quiet</i> way this dear

to have a half-holiday, Alice is to <i>dine</i> for the first time in
the evening with us; we shall drink <i>the Archduke and Archduchess's</i>

<p class="ind">Vicky (who is painting in the Alcove near me) wishes me

<span class="rightnote">THE MILITIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>2nd August 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has to thank Lord Palmerston for his letter
of the 27th July.</p>

<p class="ind">The embodying of the Militia will be a most necessary
measure, as well for the defence of our own country, and for
keeping up on the Continent of Europe the knowledge that
we are not in a defenceless state, as for the purpose of obtaining
a sufficient number of volunteers for the Army.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes, therefore, that the Militia to be embodied
will be on a proper and sufficient scale. She must say, that
the last accounts from India show so formidable a state of
things that the military measures hitherto taken by the
Home Government, on whom the salvation of India must
mainly depend, appear to the Queen as by no means adequate
to the emergency. We have nearly gone to the full extent
of our available means, just as we did in the Crimean War,
and may be able to obtain successes; but we have not
laid in a store of troops, nor formed Reserves which could
carry us over a long struggle, or meet unforeseen new
calls. Herein we are always most shortsighted, and have
finally to suffer either in power and reputation, or to pay
enormous sums for small advantages in the end&mdash;generally
both.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes that the Cabinet will look the question
boldly in the face; nothing could be better than the Resolutions
passed in the House of Commons, insuring to the
Government every possible support in the adoption of vigorous
measures. It is generally the Government, and not the
House of Commons, who hang back. The Queen wishes
Lord Palmerston to communicate this letter to his Colleagues.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE NAVY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>4th August 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The defenceless state of our shores, now that the Army
has been reduced to eighteen effective Battalions, and the
evident inclinations of the Continental Powers, chiefly France
and Russia, to dictate to us with regard to the Oriental Question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.242" id="pageiii.242"></a>[page&nbsp;242]</span>
makes the Queen naturally turn her attention to the
state of our naval preparations and force.</p>

<p class="ind">To render it possible to salute the Emperor<sup>30</sup> when he
comes here, the old <i>St Vincent</i> has been brought out of the
harbour, but has been manned chiefly by the men of the
<i>Excellent</i> gunnery ship; and we have been warned by the
Admiralty not to visit the <i>Excellent</i> in consequence. This
does not show a very brilliant condition! But what is still
more worthy of consideration is, that our new fleet, which
had been completed at the end of the Russian War, was <i>a
steam</i> fleet; when it was broken up at the Peace the dockyard
expenses were also cut down, and men discharged at the very
moment when totally new and extensive arrangements became
necessary to repair and keep in a state of efficiency the
valuable steam machinery, and to house our gunboat flotilla
on shore. To render any of these steamships fit for sea, now
that they are dismantled, with our <i>small</i> means as to basins
and docks, must necessarily cost much time.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes accordingly to have a report sent to her
as to the force of screw-ships of the Line and of other classes
which can be got ready at the different dockyards, and the
time required to get them to sea for actual service; and also
the time required to launch and get ready the gunboats. She
does not wish for a mere general answer from the Lords of
the Admiralty, but for detailed reports from the Admirals
commanding at the different ports, and particularly the
Captains in command of the Steam Reserve. She would only
add that she wishes no unnecessary time to be lost in the
preparation of these reports. She requests Lord Palmerston
to have these, her wishes, carried out.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 30: The Emperor and Empress of the French arrived at Osborne on the 6th of August
on a visit to the Queen and Prince, lasting for four days, during which time much discussion
took place between the Prince and Emperor on affairs in Eastern Europe.

<span class="rightnote">DEATH OF SIR HENRY LAWRENCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>22nd August 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is afraid from the telegram of this morning
that affairs in India have not yet taken a favourable turn.
Delhi seems still to hold out, and the death of Sir H. Lawrence<sup>31</sup>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.243" id="pageiii.243"></a>[page&nbsp;243]</span>
is a great loss. The Queen must repeat to Lord Palmerston
that the measures hitherto taken by the Government are
not commensurate with the magnitude of the crisis.</p>

<p class="ind">We have given nearly all we have in reinforcements, and
if new efforts should become necessary, by the joining of the
Madras and Bombay Armies in the Revolt, for instance, it
will take months to prepare Reserves which ought now to
be ready. Ten Battalions of Militia to be called out is quite
inadequate; forty, at least, ought to be the number, for these
also exist only on paper. The augmentation of the Cavalry
and the Guards has not yet been ordered.</p>

<p class="ind">Financial difficulties don't exist; the 14,000 men sent to
India are taken over by the Indian Government, and their
expense saved to us; and this appears hardly the moment
to make savings on the Army estimates.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 31: On the previous day, the Queen and Prince had returned from a visit to Cherbourg,
and found very disquieting news from India. Sir Henry Lawrence was the Military Administrator
and Chief Commissioner of Oudh; on the 30th of May, the 71st N.I. mutinied
at Lucknow, but Sir Henry drove them from their position and fortified the Residency.
Some weeks later, on sallying out to reconnoitre, the English were driven back and
besieged in the Residency; Sir Henry dying from the effects of a wound caused by a
shell.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">RECRUITING</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>22nd August 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty.... Viscount Palmerston has had the honour of
receiving your Majesty's communication of this morning.
It is, no doubt, true that the telegraphic account received
yesterday evening does not show, that at the dates mentioned
from India, any improvement had taken place in the state
of affairs, and the loss of Sir Henry Lawrence and of General
Barnard,<sup>32</sup> but especially of the former, is deeply to be lamented.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard, however, to the measures now taking to raise
a force to supply the place of the troops sent to India, and to
enlist recruits to fill up vacancies in the Regiments in India,
Viscount Palmerston would beg to submit that the steps now
taking seem to be well calculated for their purpose. The
recruiting for the Army has gone on more rapidly than could
have been expected at this particular time of year, and in a
fortnight or three weeks from this time will proceed still more
rapidly; the ten thousand Militia to be immediately embodied
will be as much as could probably be got together at the
present moment without much local inconvenience; but if
that number should be found insufficient, it would be easy
afterwards to embody more. But, if the recruiting should
go on successfully, that number of Militiamen in addition to
the Regulars may be found sufficient. Viscount Palmerston
begs to assure your Majesty that there is no wish to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.244" id="pageiii.244"></a>[page&nbsp;244]</span>
savings on the amount voted for Army Services, but, on the
other hand, it would be very inconvenient and embarrassing
to exceed that amount without some urgent and adequate
necessity....</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>22nd August 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">In answer to Lord Palmerston's observations on our Military
preparations, the Queen must reply that, although Lord
Palmerston disclaims, on the part of the Government, the
intention of making a saving on the Army estimates out of
the fearful exigencies caused by the Indian Revolt, the facts
still remain. The Government have sent fourteen Battalions
out of the country and transferred them to the East India
Company, and they mean to replace them only by ten new
ones, whose organisation has been ordered; but even in
these, they mean for the present to save four Companies out
of every twelve. The Queen, the House of Lords, the House
of Commons, and the Press, all call out for vigorous exertion,
and the Government alone take an apologetic line, anxious
to do as little as possible, to wait for further news, to reduce
as low as possible even what they do grant, and reason as if
we had at most <i>only</i> to replace what was sent out; whilst
if new demands should come upon us, the Reserves which
ought now to be decided upon and organised, are only then
to be discussed. The Queen can the less reconcile herself
to the system, of "letting out a little sail at a time," as Lord
Palmerston called it the other day, as she feels convinced
that, if vigour and determination to get what will be eventually
wanted is shown by the Cabinet, it will pervade the whole
Government machinery and attain its object; but that if,
on the other hand, people don't see what the Government
really require, and find them satisfied with a little at a time,
even that little will not be got, as the subordinates naturally
take the tone from their superiors. Ten Militia Regiments
would not even represent the 10,000 men whom Parliament
has voted the supplies for. A Battalion will probably not
reach 600 for a time, and from these we hope to draw volunteers
again!</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes the Cabinet will yet look the whole question
in the face, and decide while there is time what they must
know will become necessary, and what must in the hurry at
the end be done less well and at, probably, double the cost.
The Queen can speak by very recent experience, having seen
exactly the same course followed in the late War.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE ARMY RESERVES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>25th August 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Palmerston's letter of yesterday,
and must say that she is deeply grieved at her want of
success in impressing upon him the importance of meeting
the present dangers by agreeing on, and maturing a general
plan by which to replace <i>in kind</i> the troops sent out of the
country, and for which the money <i>has</i> been voted by Parliament.<sup>34</sup>
To the formation of the full number of Battalions,
and their full strength in Companies, Lord Palmerston objects
that the men will not be found to fill them, and therefore it is
left undone; to the calling-out of more Militia, he objects
that they ought not to be used as Recruiting Dep&ocirc;ts, and if
many were called out the speed with which the recruiting
for the Army went on, would oblige them to be disbanded
again. The War Office pride themselves upon having got
1,000 men since the recruiting began; this is equal to 1,000
a month or 12,000 a year, the ordinary wear and tear of the
Army!! Where will the Reserves for India be to be found?
It does not suffice merely to get <i>recruits</i>, as Lord Palmerston
says; they will not become <i>soldiers</i> for six months when got,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.246" id="pageiii.246"></a>[page&nbsp;246]</span>
and in the meantime a sufficient number of Militia Regiments
ought to be drilled, and made efficient to relieve the Line
Regiments already sent, or yet to be sent, for these also are
at present necessarily good for nothing.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must say that the Government incur a fearful
responsibility towards their country by their apparent indifference.
God grant that no unforeseen European complication
fall upon this country&mdash;but we are really tempting
Providence.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes Lord Palmerston has communicated to

regiments in India, Lord Palmerston had written:&mdash;</p>

<p class="note1">"If the Militia officers were to find that they were considered merely as drill sergeants
for the Line, they would grow careless and indifferent, and many whom it is desirable
to keep in the Service would leave it.</p>

<p class="note1">"With regard to the number of Militiamen to be embodied, the question seems to be,
What is the number which will be wanted for the whole period to the 31st of March,
because it would be undesirable to call out and embody now Militia Regiments which
would become unnecessary during the winter by the progress of recruiting, and which,
from there being no funds applicable to their maintenance, it would become necessary to
disembody. The men would be now taken from industrial employment at a time when
labour is wanted, and would be turned adrift in the winter when there is less demand
for labour.</p>

<p class="note1">"With respect to recruiting for the Army, every practicable means has been adopted
to hasten its success. Recruiting parties have been scattered over the whole of the
United Kingdom, and the permanent staff of the disembodied Militia have been furnished
with Beating Warrants enabling them to enlist recruits for the Line; and the recruiting
has been hitherto very successful. The only thing to be done is to raise men as fast as
possible, and to post them as they are raised to the Regiments and Battalions for which
they engage. The standard, moreover, has been lowered...."

your Majesty to offer to Lord Lansdowne promotion to the

course of your Majesty's reign, long as it is to be hoped that

advice in council, his assistance in debate, and the weight of
his character in the country, without any office. His health

have not been this year such as they had been; and if
your Majesty should contemplate marking at any time your
Majesty's sense of Lord Lansdowne's public services, there
could not be a better moment for doing so than the present;
and Viscount Palmerston has reason to believe that such an
act of grace would be very gratifying to the Liberal Party,
and would be deemed well bestowed even by those who are
of opposite politics.<sup>35</sup></p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Canning to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">LETTER FROM LORD CANNING</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Calcutta</span>, <i>25th September 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and asks leave again to address your Majesty, although the
desire which he has felt that his next letter should announce
to your Majesty the fall of Delhi, and the first steps towards
a restoration of your Majesty's Authority throughout the
revolted Districts, cannot as yet be accomplished. But although
it is not in Lord Canning's power to report any very
marked success over the Rebels, he can confidently assure
your Majesty that a change in the aspect of affairs is gradually
taking place, which gives hope that the contest is drawing to
a close, and the day of punishment at hand....</p>

<p class="ind">Another ground for good hopes is the appearance of things
at Lucknow. News just received from Sir James Outram
announces that he has joined General Havelock's force at
Cawnpore, and that the Troops crossed the Ganges into Oudh
on the 19th, with hardly any opposition. The European force
now advancing on Lucknow is about [ ]<a id="footnotetagXXVI42" name="footnotetagXXVI42"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI42"><sup>42</sup></a> strong, well
provided with Artillery. The beleaguered Garrison was in
good spirits on the 16th of September, and had provisions
enough to last to the end of the month. They had lately
inflicted severe losses on their assailants, and some of the
latter had dispersed. The influential proprietors and chiefs
of the country had begun to show symptoms of siding
with us.</p>

<p class="ind">This is a very different state of things from that which
existed when General Havelock's force retired across the
Ganges in July; and Lord Canning prays and believes that
your Majesty will be spared the pain and horror of hearing
that the atrocities of Cawnpore have been re-enacted upon the
brave and enduring garrison of Lucknow. Every English
soldier who could be made to reach Cawnpore has been pushed
on to General Outram, even to the denuding of some points
of danger in the intervening country, and General Outram's
instructions are to consider the rescue of the garrison as the
one paramount object to which everything else is to give way.
The garrison (which, after all, is nothing more than the House
of the Resident, with defences hastily thrown up) contains
about three hundred and fifty European men, four hundred
and fifty women and children, and one hundred and twenty
sick, besides three hundred natives, hitherto faithful. The
city, and even the province, may be abandoned and recovered
again, but these lives must be saved now or never; and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.250" id="pageiii.250"></a>[page&nbsp;250]</span>
escape the sorrow and humiliation of such barbarities as have
already been endured elsewhere is worth any sacrifice. It
is in consideration of the state of things at these two most
critical points, Delhi and Lucknow, that Lord Canning ventures
to ask your Majesty to look hopefully to the events of
the next few weeks; notwithstanding that he is unable to
announce any signal success....</p>
<span class="rightnote">SIR COLIN CAMPBELL</span>
<p class="ind">Sir Colin Campbell has been in a state of delight ever since
his favourite 93rd landed five days ago.<a id="footnotetagXXVI43" name="footnotetagXXVI43"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI43"><sup>43</sup></a> He went to see
them on board their transport before they disembarked, and
when Lord Canning asked how he found them, replied that
the only thing amiss was that they had become too fat on the
voyage, and could not button their coats. But, indeed, all
the troops of the China force have been landed in the highest
possible condition of health and vigour. The 23rd, from its
large proportion of young soldiers, is perhaps the one most
likely to suffer from the climate and the hardships of the
Service&mdash;for, although no care or cost will be spared to keep
them in health and comfort, Lord Canning fears that hardships
there must be, seeing how vast an extent of usually productive
country will be barren for a time, and that the districts from
which some of our most valuable supplies, especially the supply
of carriage animals, are drawn, have been stripped bare, or
are still in revolt. As it is, the Commander-in-Chief has most
wisely reduced the amount of tent accommodation for officers
and men far below the ordinary luxurious Indian allowance.</p>

<p class="ind">The presence of the ships of the Royal Navy has been of
the greatest service. At least eleven thousand seamen and
marines have been contributed by them for duty on shore,
and the broadsides of the <i>Sanspareil</i>, <i>Shannon</i>, and <i>Pearl</i>,
as
they lie along the esplanade, have had a very reassuring effect
upon the inhabitants of Calcutta, who, until lately, have
insisted pertinaciously that their lives and property were in
hourly danger.<a id="footnotetagXXVI44" name="footnotetagXXVI44"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p class="ind">No line-of-battle ship has been seen in the Hooghly since
Admiral Watson sailed up to Chandernagore just a hundred
years ago;<a id="footnotetagXXVI45" name="footnotetagXXVI45"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI45"><sup>45</sup></a> and certainly nothing in his fleet was equal to
the <i>Sanspareil</i>. The natives stare at her, and call her "the
four-storied boat."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.251" id="pageiii.251"></a>[page&nbsp;251]</span>
<span class="rightnote">INDIA</span>
<p class="ind">For the future, if Delhi should fall and Lucknow be secured,
the work of pacification will go forward steadily. Many
points will have to be watched, and there may be occasional
resistance; but nothing like an organised contest against
authority is probable. The greatest difficulties will be in the
civil work of re-settlement. The recent death of Mr Colvin,<a id="footnotetagXXVI46" name="footnotetagXXVI46"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI46"><sup>46</sup></a>
the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, has
removed an officer whose experience would there have been
most valuable. He has died, fairly exhausted; and is the
fourth officer of high trust whose life has given way in the last
four months.</p>

<p class="ind">One of the greatest difficulties which lie ahead&mdash;and Lord
Canning grieves to say so to your Majesty&mdash;will be the violent
rancour of a very large proportion of the English community
against every native Indian of every class. There is a rabid
and indiscriminate vindictiveness abroad, even amongst many
who ought to set a better example, which it is impossible to
contemplate without something like a feeling of shame for
one's fellow-countrymen. Not one man in ten seems to think
that the hanging and shooting of forty or fifty thousand
mutineers, besides other Rebels, can be otherwise than practicable
and right; nor does it occur to those who talk and
write most upon the matter that for the Sovereign of England
to hold and govern India without employing, and, to a great
degree, trusting natives, both in civil and military service, is
simply impossible. It is no exaggeration to say that a vast
number of the European community would hear with pleasure
and approval that every Hindoo and Mohammedan had been
proscribed, and that none would be admitted to serve the
Government except in a menial office. That which they
desire is to see a broad line of separation, and of declared
distrust drawn between us Englishmen and every subject of
your Majesty who is not a Christian, and who has a dark skin;
and there are some who entirely refuse to believe in the
fidelity or goodwill of any native towards any European;
although many instances of the kindness and generosity of
both Hindoos and Mohammedans have come upon record
during these troubles.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE POLICY OF CLEMENCY</span>
<p class="ind">To those whose hearts have been torn by the foul barbarities
inflicted upon those dear to them any degree of bitterness
against the natives may be excused. No man will dare to
judge them for it. But the cry is raised loudest by those who
have been sitting quietly in their homes from the beginning
and have suffered little from the convulsions around them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.252" id="pageiii.252"></a>[page&nbsp;252]</span>
unless it be in pocket. It is to be feared that this feeling of
exasperation will be a great impediment in the way of restoring
tranquillity and good order, even after signal retribution shall
have been deliberately measured out to all chief offenders.<sup>47</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning is ashamed of having trespassed upon your
Majesty's indulgence at such length. He will only add that
he has taken the liberty of sending to your Majesty by this
mail a map which has just been finished, showing the distribution
of the Army throughout India at the time of the
outbreak of the Mutiny. It also shows the Regiments of the
Bengal Army which have mutinied, and those which have
been disarmed, the number of European troops arrived in
Calcutta up to the 19th of September, and whence they came;
with some few other points of information.</p>

<p class="ind">There may be some slight inaccuracies, as the first copies
of the map have only just been struck off, and have not been
corrected; but Lord Canning believes that it will be interesting
to your Majesty at the present moment.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning begs to be allowed to express his earnest wishes
for the health of your Majesty, and of His Royal Highness
Prince Albert, and to offer to your Majesty the humble assurance
of his sincere and dutiful devotion.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is much surprised at Lord Clarendon's observing
that "from what he hears the Maharajah was either from
nature or early education cruel."<sup>48</sup> He must have changed
very suddenly if this be true, for if there was a thing for which
he was remarkable, it was his extreme gentleness and kindness
of disposition. We have known him for three years (our two
boys intimately), and he always shuddered at hurting anything,
and was peculiarly gentle and kind towards children
and animals, and if anything rather timid; so that all who
knew him said he never could have had a chance in his own
country. His valet, who is a very respectable Englishman,
and has been with him ever since his twelfth year, says that
he never knew a kinder or more amiable disposition. The
Queen fears that people who do not know him well have been
led away by their present very natural feelings of hatred and
distrust of all Indians to slander him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.253" id="pageiii.253"></a>[page&nbsp;253]</span>

and to have them pointed out also to Sir Charles Wood,<sup>49</sup> viz.

Clarendon would tell Lord Bloomfield not to <i>entertain</i> the
<i>possibility</i> of such a question as the Princess Royal's marriage
taking place at Berlin.<sup>50</sup> The Queen <i>never</i> could consent to it,
both for public and private reasons, and the assumption of
its being <i>too much</i> for a Prince Royal of Prussia to <i>come</i> over to

<span class="rightnote">CRISIS IN THE CITY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>12th November 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that the condition of financial
affairs became worse to-day than it was yesterday.<a id="footnotetagXXVI53" name="footnotetagXXVI53"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVI53"><sup>53</sup></a> The
Governor of the bank represented that almost all private firms
have ceased to discount bills, and that the Reserve Fund of
the Bank of England, out of which discounts are made and
liabilities satisfied, had been reduced last night to &pound;1,400,000,
and that if that fund should become exhausted the bank would
have to suspend its operations. Under these circumstances it
appeared to Viscount Palmerston, and to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, that a case had arisen for doing the same thing
which was done under somewhat similar circumstances in
1847&mdash;that is to say, that a letter should be written by the first
Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
the Governor of the Bank of England, saying that if under
the pressure of the emergency the bank should deem it necessary
to issue more notes than the amount to which they are
at present confined by law, the Government would apply to
Parliament to grant them an indemnity.</p>

<p class="ind">This Measure, in 1847, had the effect of stopping the then
existing panic, and the necessity for making such an issue did
not arise; on the present occasion this announcement will,
no doubt, have a salutary effect in allaying the present panic,
but as the bank had to discount to-day bills to the amount of
&pound;2,000,000, which they could not have done out of a fund of
&pound;1,400,000, unless deposits and payments in, to a considerable
amount, had been made, the probability is that the issue thus
authorised will actually be made. The Governor and Deputy-Governor
of the bank represented that the communication,
in order to be effectual and to save from ruin firms which were
in imminent danger, ought to be made forthwith, so that they
might be enabled to announce it on the Stock Exchange before
the closing of business at four o'clock. Viscount Palmerston
and Sir George Lewis therefore signed at once, and gave to the
Governor of the bank the letter of which the accompanying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.256" id="pageiii.256"></a>[page&nbsp;256]</span>
paper is a copy, the pressure of the matter not allowing time
to take your Majesty's pleasure beforehand.</p>
<span class="rightnote">SUSPENSION OF BANK CHARTER ACT</span>
<p class="ind">The state of things now is more urgent than that which
existed in 1847, when the similar step was taken; at that time
the Reserve Fund was about &pound;1,900,000, last night it was only
&pound;1,400,000; at that time the bullion in the bank was above
&pound;8,000,000, it is now somewhat less than &pound;8,000,000; at that
time things were mending, they are now getting worse.</p>

<p class="ind">But however necessary this Measure has been considered,
and however useful it may be expected to be, it inevitably
entails one very inconvenient consequence. The Government
have authorised the bank to break the law, and whether the
law shall actually be broken or not, it would be highly unconstitutional
for the Government not to take the earliest opportunity
of submitting the matter to the knowledge of Parliament.
This course was pursued in 1847. The letter from
Lord John Russell and Sir Charles Wood to the Governor of the
bank was dated on the 25th October, Parliament then stood
prorogued in the usual way to the 11th November, but a council
was held on the 31st October, at which your Majesty summoned
Parliament to meet for the despatch of business on the
18th November; and on that day the session was opened
in the usual way by a Speech from the Throne. It would be
impossible under present circumstances to put off till the
beginning of February a communication to Parliament of the
step taken to-day.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston therefore would beg to submit for your
Majesty's approval that a Council might be held at Windsor
on Monday next, and that Parliament might then be summoned
to meet in fourteen days. This would bring Parliament
together in the first days of December, and after sitting
ten days, or a fortnight, if necessary, it might be adjourned till
the first week in February.<sup>54</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston submits an explanatory Memorandum
which he has just received for your Majesty's information from
the Chancellor of the Exchequer....</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;"><a id="footnoteXXVI53" name="footnoteXXVI53"></a>
<a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagXXVI53">Footnote 53:</a> The financial crisis had originated in numerous stoppages of banks in the United
States, where premature schemes of railway extension had involved countless investors
in ruin; in consequence, the pressure on firms and financial houses became even more
acute than in 1847; see <i>ante</i>, vol. ii. pp. <a href="../../24780/24780-h/24780-h.htm#pageii.130" style="font-weight: normal;">130</a>, <a href="../../24780/24780-h/24780-h.htm#pageii.131" style="font-weight: normal;">131</a>. The bank rate now rose to 10 per
cent. as against 9 per cent. in that year, and the bank reserve of bullion was alarmingly
depleted.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 54: Parliament accordingly met on the 3rd of December, and the Session was opened
by the Queen in person. The Act of Indemnity was passed without serious opposition,
and a select committee re-appointed to enquire into the operation of the Bank Charter
Act.

<span class="rightnote">ARMY ESTABLISHMENT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>18th December 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has had some correspondence with Lord Panmure
upon the Establishment of the Army for the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.257" id="pageiii.257"></a>[page&nbsp;257]</span>
financial year.<sup>55</sup> She wishes now to lay down the principle
which she thinks ought to guide our decision, and asks Lord
Palmerston to consider it with his colleagues in Cabinet. Last
year we reduced our Army suddenly to a low peace establishment
to meet the demand for reduction of taxation raised
in the House of Commons. With this peace establishment we
had to meet the extraordinary demands of India, we have
sent almost every available regiment, battalion, and battery,
and are forced to contemplate the certainty of a large increase
of our force in India as a permanent necessity. What the
Queen requires is, that a well-considered and digested estimate
should be made of the additional regiments, etc., etc., so required,
and that after deducting this number from our establishment
of 1857-1858, that for the next year should be brought
up again to the same condition as if the Indian demand, which
is foreign to our ordinary consideration, had not arisen. If this
be done it will still leave us militarily weaker than we were at
the beginning of the year, for the larger English Army maintained
in India will require proportionally more reliefs and
larger dep&ocirc;ts.</p>

<p class="ind">As the Indian finances pay for the troops employed in
India, the Force at home and in the colonies will, when
raised to its old strength, not cost a shilling more than the
peace establishment of 1857 settled under a pressure of
financial reduction.</p>

<p class="ind">Anything less than this will not leave this country in a safe
condition. The Queen does not ask only for the same number
of men as in 1857-1858, but particularly for Regiments of
Cavalry, Battalions of Infantry and Batteries of Artillery,
which alone would enable us in case of a war to effect the
increase to a war establishment.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen encloses her answer to Lord Panmure's last
letter.</p>

<span class="rightnote">GOVERNMENT OF INDIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>24th December 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen only now returns to Lord Palmerston the Memorandum
containing the Heads of an arrangement for the future
Government of India, which the Committee of Cabinet have
agreed to recommend. She will have an opportunity of seeing
Lord Palmerston before the Cabinet meet again, and to hear
a little more in detail the reasons which influenced the Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.258" id="pageiii.258"></a>[page&nbsp;258]</span>
in their several decisions. She wishes only to recommend
two points to Lord Palmerston's consideration: 1st, the
mode of communication between the Queen and the new
Government which it is intended to establish. As long as the
Government was that of the Company, the Sovereign was
generally left quite ignorant of decisions and despatches; now
that the Government is to be that of the Sovereign, and the
direction will, she presumes, be given in her name, a direct
official responsibility to her will have to be established. She
doubts whether any one but a Secretary of State could speak
in the Queen's name, like the Foreign Secretary to Foreign
Courts, the Colonial Secretary to the Governors of the Colonies,
and the Home Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland
and the Lieutenants of the Counties of Great Britain, the
Judges, Convocations, Mayors, etc., etc. On the other hand,
would the position of a Secretary of State be compatible with
his being President of a Council? The Treasury and Admiralty
act as "My Lords," but they only administer special
departments, and do not direct the policy of a country in the
Queen's name. The mixture of supreme direction, and also
of the conduct of the administration of the department to be
directed, has in practice been found as inconvenient in the
War Department as it is wrong in principle.</p>

<p class="ind">The other point is the importance of having only <i>one</i> Army,
whether native, local, or general, with one discipline and one
command, that of the Commander-in-Chief. This is quite
compatible with first appointments to the native Army, being
vested as a point of patronage in the members of the Council,
but it ought to be distinctly recognised in order to do away
with those miserable jealousies between the different military
services, which have done more harm to us in India than,
perhaps, any other circumstance.</p>

<p class="ind">Perhaps Lord Palmerston would circulate this letter
amongst the members of the Committee who agreed upon the
proposed scheme?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.259" id="pageiii.259"></a>[page&nbsp;259]</span>
sentiments with which your Majesty would view the spirit
of bitter and unreasoning vengeance against your Majesty's
Indian subjects with which too many minds are imbued in
England as well as in this country, it has been an indescribable
pleasure to him to read what your Majesty has condescended
to write to him upon this painful topic. Your Majesty's
gracious kindness in the reference made by your Majesty to
what is said by the newspapers is also deeply felt by Lord
Canning. He can truly and conscientiously assure your
Majesty of his indifference to all such attacks&mdash;an indifference
so complete indeed as to surprise himself.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning fears that the satisfaction which your Majesty
will have experienced very shortly after the date of your
Majesty's letter, upon receiving the news of Sir Henry Havelock's
entry into Lucknow, will have been painfully checked
by the long and apparently blank interval which followed,
and during which your Majesty's anxieties for the ultimate
safety of the garrison, largely increased by many precious
lives, must have become more intense than ever. Happily,
this suspense is over; and the real rescue effected by a glorious
combination of skill and intrepidity on the part of Sir Colin
Campbell and his troops must have been truly gratifying to
your Majesty.<sup>56</sup> The defence of Lucknow and the relief of the
defenders are two exploits which, each in their kind, will stand
out brightly in the history of these terrible times.</p>

<p class="ind"> ... Lord Canning has not failed to transmit your Majesty's
gracious message to Sir Colin Campbell, and has taken the
liberty to add your Majesty's words respecting his favourite
93rd, which will not be less grateful to the brave old soldier
than the expression of your Majesty's consideration for
himself.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty has lost two most valuable officers in Sir
Henry Havelock and Brigadier-General Neill. They were very
different, however. The first was quite of the old school&mdash;severe
and precise with his men, and very cautious in his
movements and plans&mdash;but in action bold as well as skilful.
The second very open and impetuous, but full of resources;
and to his soldiers as kind and thoughtful of their comfort as
if they had been his children.</p>

<p class="ind">With earnest wishes for the health and happiness of your
Majesty and the Prince, Lord Canning begs permission to lay

<span class="rightnote">ARMY ORGANISATION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>29th December 1857</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Panmure's letter and Memorandum
of the 24th. She must say that she still adheres to
her views as formerly expressed. Lord Panmure admits that
the two plans don't differ materially in expense. It becomes,
then, a mere question of organisation and of policy. As to
the first, all military authorities of all countries and times
agree upon the point that numerous <i>cadres</i> with fewer men give
the readiest means of increasing an army on short notice, the
main point to be attended to in a constitutional and democratic
country like England. As to the second, a system of organisation
will always be easier defended than mere numbers
arbitrarily fixed, and Parliament ought to have the possibility
of voting more or voting fewer men, according to their views of
the exigencies of the country, or the pressure of finance at
different times, and to be able to do so without deranging the
organisation.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes Lord Panmure will look at our position,
as if the Indian demands had not arisen, and he will find that
to come to Parliament with the Cavalry borne on the estimates
reduced by three regiments (as will be the case even after two
shall have returned from India, and the two new ones shall
have been formed), will certainly not prove <i>too little</i> anxiety
on the part of the Government to cut down our military
establishments.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXVII</h3>


<p>On the 25th of January of the new year (1858) Prince Frederick
William of Prussia (afterwards the Emperor Frederick) was married,
with brilliant ceremonial, to the Princess Royal, at the Chapel Royal,
St James's, an event marked by general national rejoicings; another
event in the private life of the Queen, but one of a melancholy
character, was the death of the Duchess of Orleans at the age of
forty-four.</p>

<p>A determined attempt was made by Orsini, Pierri, and others,
members of the Carbonari Society, to assassinate the Emperor and
Empress of the French by throwing grenades filled with detonating
powder under their carriage. The Emperor was only slightly hurt,
but several bystanders were killed, and very many more wounded.
The plot had been conceived, and the grenades manufactured in
England, and a violently hostile feeling was engendered in France
against this country, owing to the prescriptive right of asylum enjoyed
by foreign refugees. The French <i>militaires</i> were particularly vehement
in their language, and Lord Palmerston so far bowed to the
demands of the French Foreign Minister as to introduce a Bill to
make the offence of conspiracy to murder, a felony instead of, as it
had previously been, a misdemeanour. The Conservative Party
supported the introduction of the Bill, but, on the second reading,
joined with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'eighy'">eighty</ins>-four Liberals and four Peelites in supporting an
Amendment by Mr Milner Gibson, postponing the reform of the
Criminal Law till the peremptory demands of Count Walewski had
been formally answered. The Ministry was defeated and resigned,
and Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli returned to Office. Orsini and Pierri
were executed in Paris, but the state trial in London of a Dr Bernard,
a resident of Bayswater, for complicity, ended, mainly owing to the
menacing attitude of France over the whole question, in an acquittal.
The Italian nationality of the chief conspirators endangered, but
only temporarily, the important <i>entente</i> between France and Sardinia.</p>

<p>Before the resignation of the Ministry, the thanks of both Houses
of Parliament were voted to the civil and military officers of India
for their exertions in suppressing the Mutiny; the Opposition endeavoured
to obtain the omission of the name of Lord Canning from
the address, till his conduct of affairs had been discussed. The
difficulties in India were not at an end, for Sir Colin Campbell had
been unable to hold Lucknow, and had transferred the rescued garrison
to Cawnpore, which he re-occupied. It was not till the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.262" id="pageiii.262"></a>[page&nbsp;262]</span>
March that Lucknow was captured by the Commander-in-Chief, who
was raised to the peerage as Lord Clyde, after the taking of Jhansi
and of Gwalior in Central India, by Sir Hugh Rose, had virtually
terminated the revolt.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the capture of Lucknow, the Governor-General
had prepared a proclamation for promulgation in Oudh, announcing
that, except in the case of certain loyal Rajahs, proprietary rights
in the soil of the province would be confiscated. One copy of the
draft was sent home, and another shown to Sir James Outram, Chief
Commissioner of Oudh, and, in consequence of the latter's protest
against its severity, as making confiscation the rule and not the
exception, an exemption was inserted in favour of such landowners
as should actively co-operate in restoring order. On receiving the
draft in its unaltered form, Lord Ellenborough, the new President of
the Board of Control, forwarded a despatch to Lord Canning, strongly
condemning his action, and, on the publication of this despatch, the
Ministry narrowly escaped Parliamentary censure. Lord Ellenborough
himself resigned, and was succeeded by Lord Stanley.
Attempts had been made by both Lord Palmerston and Lord Derby
to pass measures for the better government of India. After two Bills
had been introduced and withdrawn, the procedure by resolution
was resorted to, and a measure was ultimately passed transferring
the Government of India to the Crown.</p>

<p>The China War terminated on the 26th of June, by the treaty of
Tien-tsin, which renewed the treaty of 1842, and further opened up
China to British commerce. A dispute with Japan led to a treaty
signed at Yeddo by Lord Elgin and the representatives of the Tycoon,
enlarging British diplomatic and trade privileges in that country.</p>

<p>The Budget of Mr Disraeli imposed for the first time a penny stamp
on bankers' cheques; a compromise was arrived at on the Oaths
question, the words "on the true faith of a Christian" having hitherto
prevented Jews from sitting in Parliament. They were now enabled
to take the oath with the omission of these words, and Baron
Rothschild took his seat for the City of London accordingly.</p>

<p>Among the other events of importance in the year were the satisfactory
termination of a dispute with the Neapolitan Government
arising out of the seizure of the <i>Cagliari</i>; a modified union, under a
central Commission, of Moldavia and Wallachia; the despatch of
Mr Gladstone by the Conservative Government as High Commissioner
to the Ionian Islands; and the selection of Ottawa, formerly
known as Bytown, for the capital of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

of the Imperial carriage at the Opera House in the Rue Lepelletier, explosive hand-grenades
were thrown at it, and though the Emperor and Empress were unhurt, ten people
were either killed outright or died of their wounds, and over one hundred and fifty were
injured. Notwithstanding the scene of carnage, their Majesties maintained their composure
and sat through the performance of the Opera. In the addresses of congratulation
to the Emperor on his escape (published, some of them inadvertently, in the official
<i>Moniteur</i>), officers commanding French regiments used language of the most insulting
character to England, and Count Walewski, the French Foreign Minister, in a despatch,
recommended the British Government to take steps to prevent the right of asylum being
abused.

<span class="rightnote">DEFEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>19th February 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and is sorry to have to inform your Majesty that the
Government were beat this evening on Mr Milner Gibson's<a id="footnotetagXXVII4" name="footnotetagXXVII4"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVII4"><sup>4</sup></a>
Amendment by a majority of 19,<a id="footnotetagXXVII5" name="footnotetagXXVII5"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVII5"><sup>5</sup></a> the numbers being for his
Amendment, 234, and against it 215.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Milner Gibson began the Debate by moving his Amendment
in a speech of considerable ability, but abounding in
misrepresentation, which nevertheless produced a marked
effect upon the House. Mr Baines followed, but only argued
the Bill without replying to Mr Gibson's speech. This was
remarked upon by Mr Walpole, who followed him, and who
said that though he approved of the Bill he could not vote for
reading it a second time until Count Walewski's despatch had
been answered. Mr MacMahon supported the Amendment,
as did Mr Byng. Sir George Grey, who followed Mr Walpole,
defended the Bill and the course pursued by the Government
in not having answered Count Walewski's despatch until after
the House of Commons should have affirmed the Bill by a
Second Reading. Mr Spooner remained steady to his purpose,
and would vote against the Amendment, though in doing so
he should differ from his friends. Lord Harry Vane opposed
the Amendment, as interfering with the passing of the Bill,
and Mr Bentinck took the same line, and replied to some of
the arguments of Mr Milner Gibson. Mr Henley said he
should vote for the Amendment. The Lord Advocate made a
good speech against it. Mr Gladstone spoke with his usual
talent in favour of the Amendment, and was answered by the
Attorney-General in a speech which would have convinced
men who had not taken a previous determination. He was
followed by Mr Disraeli, who seemed confident of success, and
he was replied to by Viscount Palmerston, and the House then
divided.</p>

<p class="ind">It seems that Lord Derby had caught at an opportunity of
putting the Government in a minority. He saw that there
were ninety-nine Members who were chiefly of the Liberal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.266" id="pageiii.266"></a>[page&nbsp;266]</span>
Party, who had voted against the Bill when it was first proposed,
and who were determined to oppose it in all its stages.
He calculated that if his own followers were to join those
ninety-nine, the Government might be run hard, or perhaps be
beaten, and he desired all his friends<sup>6</sup> to support Mr Milner
Gibson; on the other hand, many of the supporters of the
Government, relying upon the majority of 200, by which
the leave to bring the Bill in had been carried, and upon the
majority of 145 of last night, had gone out of town for a few
days, not anticipating any danger to the Government from
Mr Gibson's Motion, and thus an adverse division was obtained.
Moreover, Count Walewski's despatch, the tone and
tenor of which had been much misrepresented, had produced
a very unfavourable effect on the mind of members in general,
and there was a prevailing feeling very difficult to overcome,
that the proposed Bill was somehow or other a concession to
the demand of a Foreign Government. The Cabinet will have
to consider at its meeting at three o'clock to-morrow what
course the Government will have to pursue.</p>

the feeling gained ground that the Government had shown undue subservience in
meeting the representations of the French Ambassador. The despatch had not actually
been answered, although verbal communications had taken place. The opposition to
the Bill was concerted by Lord John Russell and Sir James Graham; see Parker's <i>Sir
James Graham</i>, vol. ii. p. 236, and the observation of the Prince, <i>post</i>, <a href="#pageiii.268" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 268</a>. The

<span class="rightnote">RESIGNATION OF THE GOVERNMENT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>21st February 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Palmerston came at five o'clock from the Cabinet, and
tendered his resignation in his own name, and that of his
Colleagues. The Cabinet had well considered their position
and found that, as the vote passed by the House, although the
result of an accidental combination of parties, was virtually
a vote of censure upon their conduct, they could not with
honour or with any advantage to the public service carry on
the Government.</p>

<p class="ind">The combination was the whole of the Conservative Party
(Lord Derby's followers), Lord John Russell, the Peelites,
with Mr Gladstone and the whole of the Radicals; but the
Liberal Party generally is just now very angry with Lord
Palmerston personally, chiefly on account of his apparent
submission to French dictation, and the late appointment of
Lord Clanricarde as Privy Seal, who is looked upon as a reprobate.<sup>7</sup>
Lord Clanricarde's presence in the House of Commons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.267" id="pageiii.267"></a>[page&nbsp;267]</span>
during the Debate, and in a conspicuous place, enraged many
supporters of Lord Palmerston to that degree that they voted
at once with the Opposition.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 7: Since his triumph at the polls in 1857, Lord Palmerston had been somewhat arbitrary
in his demeanour, and had defied public opinion by taking Lord Clanricarde into the
Government, after some unpleasant disclosures in the Irish Courts. While walking
home on the 18th, after obtaining an immense majority on the India Bill, he was told
by Sir Joseph Bethell that he ought, like the Roman Consuls in a triumph, to have some
one to remind him that he was, as a minister, not immortal. Next day he was defeated.
</p>
<span class="rightnote">LORD DERBY SUMMONED</span>
<p class="ind">The Queen wrote to Lord Derby the letter here following;<sup>8</sup>
he came a little after six o'clock. He stated that nobody was
more surprised in his life than he had been at the result of
the Debate, after the Government had only a few days before
had a majority of more than 100 on the introduction of their
Bill. He did not know how it came about, but thought it
was the work of Lord John Russell and Sir James Graham in
the interest of the Radicals; Mr Gladstone's junction must
have been accidental. As to his own people, they had, owing
to his own personal exertions, as the Queen was aware, though
many very unwillingly, supported the Bill; but the amendment
of Mr Milner Gibson was so skilfully worded, that it was
difficult for them not to vote for it; he had to admit this
when they came to him to ask what they should do, merely
warning them to save the Measure itself, which the Amendment
did. He then blamed the Government very much
for leaving Count Walewski's despatch unanswered before
coming before Parliament, which he could hardly understand.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 8: Summoning him to advise her.
</p>
<span class="rightnote">OFFER TO LORD DERBY</span>
<p class="ind">On the Queen telling him that the Government had resigned,
and that she commissioned him to form a new Administration,
he begged that this offer might not be made to him without
further consideration, and would state clearly his own position.
After what had happened in 1851 and 1855, if the
Queen made the offer he <i>must</i> accept it, for if he refused, the
Conservative Party would be broken up for ever. Yet he
would find a majority of two to one against him in the House
of Commons, would have difficulty in well filling the important
offices, found the external and internal relations of the country
in a most delicate and complicated position, war in India
and in China, difficulties with France, the Indian Bill introduced
and a Reform Bill promised; nothing but the forbearance
and support of some of his opponents would make
it possible for him to carry on any Government. The person
who was asked first by the Sovereign had always a great disadvantage;
perhaps other combinations were possible, which,
if found not to answer, would make him more readily accepted
by the country. The position of Lord Palmerston was a most
curious one, the House of Commons had been returned chiefly
for the purpose of supporting him <i>personally</i>, and he had
obtained a working majority of 100 (unheard of since the
Reform Bill), yet his supporters had no principles in common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.268" id="pageiii.268"></a>[page&nbsp;268]</span>
and they generally suspected him; the question of the Reform
Bill had made him and Lord John run a race for popularity
which might lead to disastrous consequences. Lord Derby
did not at all know what support he would be able to obtain
in Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen agreed to deferring her offer, and to take further
time for consideration on the understanding that if she made
it it would at once be accepted. Lord Derby expressed,
however, his fear that the resignation of the Palmerston
Cabinet might only be for the purpose of going through a
crisis in order to come back again with new strength, for there
existed different kinds of resignations, some for this purpose,
others really for abandoning office.</p>

<p class="ind">A conversation which I had with Lord Clarendon after
dinner, convinced me that the Cabinet had sent in their resignations
from the real conviction of the impossibility to go
on with honour and success; all offers of the friends of the
Government to pass a vote of confidence, etc., etc., had been
rejected. Lord Derby was the only man who could form a
Government; Mr Gladstone would probably join him. The
whole move had been planned, and most dexterously, by Sir
James Graham.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>21st February 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has reconsidered the question of the formation
of a new Government as she had settled with Lord Derby
yesterday, and now writes to him to tell him that further
reflection has only confirmed her in her former resolution to
offer the task to Lord Derby. The resignation of the present
Government is the result of a conscientious conviction on
their part, that, damaged by the censure passed upon them
in the House of Commons, they cannot with honour to themselves,
or usefulness to the country, carry on public affairs,
and Lord Derby is at the head of the only Party which affords
the materials of forming a new Government, is sufficiently
organised to secure a certain support, and which the country
would accept as an alternative for that hitherto in power.
Before actually offering any specific office to anybody, Lord
Derby would perhaps have another interview with the Queen;
but it would be right that he should have satisfied himself
a little as to his chances of strengthening his hands before she
sees him. With regard to the position of the India Bill,
the Queen must also have a further conversation with him.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD DERBY'S VIEW</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">St James's Square</span>, <i>21st February 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, begs your Majesty to
accept his grateful acknowledgment of the signal mark of
your Majesty's favour, with which he has this morning been
honoured. Encouraged by your Majesty's gracious confidence,
he does not hesitate to submit himself to your Majesty's
pleasure, and will address himself at once to the difficult
task which your Majesty has been pleased to entrust to him.
He fears that he can hardly hope, in the formation of a Government,
for much extrinsic aid; as almost all the men of eminence
in either House of Parliament are more or less associated
with other parties, whose co-operation it would be impossible
to obtain. Lord Derby will not, however, hesitate to make
the attempt in any quarters, in which he may think he has
any chance of success. With regard to the filling up of particular
offices, Lord Derby would humbly beg your Majesty
to bear in mind that, although among his own personal friends
there will be every desire to make individual convenience
subservient to the public interest, yet among those who are
not now politically connected with him, there may be some,
whose co-operation or refusal might be greatly influenced
by the office which it was proposed that they should hold;
and, in such cases, Lord Derby must venture to bespeak
your Majesty's indulgence should he make a definite offer,
subject, of course, to your Majesty's ultimate approval.</p>

<p class="ind">As soon as Lord Derby has made any progress in his proposed
arrangements, he will avail himself of your Majesty's
gracious permission to solicit another Audience.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>21st February 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has just received Lord Derby's letter, and
would wish under all circumstances to see him at six this
evening, in order to hear what progress he has made in his
plans. The two offices the Queen is most anxious should not
be prejudged in any way, before the Queen has seen Lord
Derby again, are the Foreign and the War Departments.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">MR GLADSTONE AND LORD GREY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">St James's Square</span>, <i>21st February 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty
the two letters which he has this evening received from Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.270" id="pageiii.270"></a>[page&nbsp;270]</span>
Grey and Mr Gladstone.<sup>9</sup> The reasons contained in the
latter do not appear to Lord Derby to be very conclusive;
but he fears the result must be that he cannot look, in the
attempt to form a Cabinet, to much extraneous assistance.
With deep regret Lord Derby is compelled to add that he
finds he cannot rely with certainty on the support of his son
as a member of his proposed Cabinet.<a id="footnotetagXXVII10" name="footnotetagXXVII10"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVII10"><sup>10</sup></a> Still, having undertaken
the task he has in obedience to your Majesty's commands,
Lord Derby will not relax in his efforts to frame such
a Government as may be honoured with your Majesty's
gracious approval, and prove itself equal to the emergency
which calls it together.</p>

<p class="ind">While in the very act of putting up this letter, Lord Derby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.271" id="pageiii.271"></a>[page&nbsp;271]</span>
has received one, which he also presumes to enclose to your
Majesty, from Lord St Leonards, alleging his advanced age
as a reason for not accepting the Great Seal which he formerly
held. This reply has been wholly unexpected; and it is
yet possible that Lord St Leonards may be induced, at least
temporarily, to withdraw his resignation. Should it, however,
prove otherwise, and Lord Derby should succeed in making
his other arrangements, he would humbly ask your Majesty's
permission to endeavour to persuade Mr Pemberton Leigh to
accept that high office, of course accompanied by the honour
of the Peerage, which he is aware has been already on more
than one occasion offered to him. Lord Derby begs to add
that he has not had the slightest communication with Mr
Pemberton Leigh on the subject, nor has the least idea as to
his feelings upon it.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 9: Lord Grey wrote&mdash;"I am much obliged to you for the manner in which you have
asked my assistance in performing the task confided to you by Her Majesty.</p>

<p class="note1">"I am not insensible to the danger of the present crisis, or to the duty it imposes on
public men, of giving any aid in their power towards forming an Administration which
may command respect. I am also aware that the settlement of the important political
questions, on which we have differed, has removed many of the obstacles which would
formerly have rendered my acting with you impracticable. Upon the other hand, upon
carefully considering the present state of affairs and the materials at your disposal (especially
in the House of Commons) for forming an Administration, and that all the political
friends with whom I have been connected, would probably be opposed to it, I do not
think it would be either useful to you or honourable to myself that I should singly join
your Government."</p>

<p class="note1">Mr Gladstone wrote&mdash;"I am very sensible of the importance of the vote taken on
Friday, and I should deeply lament to see the House of Commons trampled on in consequence
of that vote. The honour of the House is materially involved in giving it full
effect. It would therefore be my first wish to aid, if possible, in such a task; and remembering
the years when we were colleagues, I may be permitted to say that there is
nothing in the fact of your being the Head of a Ministry, which would avail to deter me
from forming part of it.</p>

<p class="note1">"Among the first questions I have had to put to myself in consequence of the offer,
which you have conveyed to me in such friendly and flattering terms, has been the
question, whether it would be in my power by accepting it, either alone, or in concert
with others, to render you material service.</p>

<p class="note1">"After the long years, during which we have been separated, there would be various
matters of public interest requiring to be noticed between us; but the question I have
mentioned is a needful preliminary.</p>

<p class="note1">"Upon the best consideration which the moment allows, I think it plain that alone,
as I must be, I could not render you service worth your having.</p>

<p class="note1">"The dissolution of last year excluded from Parliament men with whom I had sympathies,
and it in some degree affected the position of those political friends with whom
I have now for many years been united, through evil and (much more rarely) good report.</p>

<p class="note1">"Those who lament the rupture of old traditions may well desire the reconstruction
of a Party; but the reconstitution of a Party can only be effected, if at all, by the return
of the old influences to their places, and not by the junction of one isolated person.</p>

<p class="note1">"The difficulty is now enhanced in my case by the fact that in your party, reduced as
it is at the present moment in numbers, there is a small but active and not unimportant
section, who avowedly regard me as the representative of the most dangerous ideas. I
should thus, unfortunately, be to you a source of weakness in the heart of your own
adherents, while I should bring you no Party or group of friends to make up for their
defection or discontent.</p>

<p class="note1">"For the reasons which I have thus stated or glanced at, my reply to your letter must
be in the negative.</p>

<p class="note1">"I must, however, add that a Government formed by you at this time will in my opinion
have strong claims upon me, and upon any one situated as I am, for favourable presumptions,
and in the absence of conscientious difference on important questions, for
support.</p>

<p class="note1">"I have had an opportunity of seeing Lord Aberdeen and Sidney Herbert, and they
fully concur in the sentiment I have just expressed."</p>

expected from what the Duke must have told him, in his
declaring his conviction that he could be of no use to the
new Government by joining it, or in persuading his friends
to change their minds as to joining. The Duke was evidently
much pleased by the offer, but from all he said of his position,
the Queen could gather that it was in vain to press him further.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Malmesbury to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE ORSINI PLOT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>7th March 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Earl of Malmesbury presents his humble duty to the
Queen, and has the honour to thank your Majesty for the
interesting letter<sup>12</sup> sent to him by your Majesty, and which
he returns to your Majesty by this messenger. Lord Malmesbury
hopes and believes that much of the excitement that
prevailed on the <i>other</i> side the water is subsiding. All his
letters from <i>private</i> sources, and the account of Colonel Claremont,
agree on this point. In this country, if our differences
with France are settled, it is probable that the popular jealousy
of foreign interference will be killed; but at least for some
time it will show foreign Courts how dangerous it is <i>even to
criticise</i> our <i>domestic</i> Institutions. Lord Malmesbury has
carefully abstained from giving Lord Cowley or M. de Persigny
the slightest hope that we could alter the law, but has confined
himself to saying that the law was itself as much on its
trial as the prisoners Bernard and Truelove.<sup>13</sup> If, therefore,
the law should prove to be a phantom of justice, or anomalous
in its action, whatever measures your Majesty's Government
may hereafter take to reform it, it will be received by France
as an unexpected boon and a proof of good faith and amity.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR AND THE CARBONARI</span>

<p class="ind">In attending to the idea referred to by your Majesty that
the Emperor took the oath of the Assassins' Society, Lord
Malmesbury can almost assure your Majesty that such is not
the case.<sup>14</sup> Lord Malmesbury first made His Majesty's acquaintance
in Italy when they were both very young men
(twenty years of age). They were <i>both</i> under the influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.274" id="pageiii.274"></a>[page&nbsp;274]</span>
of those romantic feelings which the former history and the
present degradation of Italy may naturally inspire even at a
more advanced time of life&mdash;and the Prince Louis Napoleon,
to the knowledge of Lord Malmesbury, certainly engaged
himself in the conspiracies of the time&mdash;but it was with the
higher class of the Carbonari, men like General Sercognani
and General P&eacute;p&eacute;. The Prince used to talk to Lord Malmesbury
upon these men and their ideas and plans with all the
openness that exists between two youths, and Lord Malmesbury
has many times heard him condemn with disgust the
societies of villains which hung on the flank of the conspirators,
and which deterred many of the best families and ablest
gentlemen in Romagna from joining them. Lord Malmesbury
believes the report therefore to be a fable, and at some future
period will, if it should interest your Majesty, relate to your
Majesty some details respecting the Emperor's share in the
conspiracies of 1828-1829....</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 12: This was a letter from the Prince de Chimay to the King of the Belgians in reference
to the Orsini plot.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 13: Before Lord Palmerston's Government had retired, Simon Bernard, a resident of
Bayswater, was committed for trial for complicity in the Orsini <i>attentat</i>. He was committed
for conspiracy only, but, at the instance of the new Government, the charge was
altered to one of feloniously slaying one of the persons killed by the explosion. As this
constructive murder was actually committed on French soil, Bernard's trial had, under
the existing law, to be held before a Special Commission, over which Lord Campbell
presided. The evidence overwhelmingly established the prisoner's guilt, but, carried
away by the eloquent, if irrelevant, speech of Mr Edwin James for the defence, the jury
acquitted him. Truelove was charged with criminal libel, for openly approving, in a
published pamphlet, Orsini's attempt, and regretting its failure. The Government
threw up the prosecution, pusillanimously in the judgment of Lord Campbell, who records
that he carefuly studied, with a view to his own hearing of the case, the proceedings
against Lord George Gordon for libelling Marie Antoinette, against Vint for libelling the
Emperor Paul, and against Peltier for libelling Napoleon I.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 14: The Queen had written:&mdash;"There are people who pretend that the Emperor, who
was once a member of the Carbonari Club of Italy, and who is supposed to be condemned
to death by the rules of that Secret Society for having violated his oath to them, has
offered them to pardon Orsini, if they would release him from his oath, but that the
Society refused the offer. The fact that all the attempts have been made by Italians,
Orsini's letter, and the almost mad state of fear in which the Emperor seems to be now,
would give colour to that story." Orsini had written two letters to the Emperor, one
read aloud at his trial by his counsel, Jules Favre, the other while lying under sentence
of death. He entreated the Emperor to secure Italian independence.

<p class="ind">The Opposition benches very full; the temper not kind.</p>

<p class="ind">The French announcement,<sup>15</sup> which was quite unexpected,
elicited cheers, but only from the Ministerial side, which, he
confesses, for a moment almost daunted him.</p>

<p class="ind">Then came a question about the <i>Cagliari</i> affair,<sup>16</sup> on which
the Government had agreed to take a temperate course, in
deference to their predecessors&mdash;but it was not successful.
The ill-humour of the House, diverted for a moment by the
French news, vented itself on this head.</p>

<p class="ind">What struck the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the course
of the evening most was the absence of all those symptoms
of "fair trial," etc., which have abounded of late in journals
and in Society.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John said something; Mr Gladstone said something;
but it was not encouraging.</p>

<p class="ind">Nevertheless, in 1852 "fair trial" observations abounded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.275" id="pageiii.275"></a>[page&nbsp;275]</span>
and the result was not satisfactory; now it may be the
reverse.</p>

<p class="ind">The House is wild and capricious at this moment.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty once deigned to say that your Majesty
wished in these remarks to have the temper of the House
placed before your Majesty, and to find what your Majesty
could not meet in newspapers. This is the Chancellor of the
Exchequer's excuse for these rough notes, written on the
field of battle, which he humbly offers to your Majesty.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 15: Parliament reassembled on the 12th of March, and Mr Disraeli then stated that the
"painful misconceptions" which had for some time existed between England and France
had been "terminated in a spirit entirely friendly and honourable."</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 16: Two English engineers, Watt and Park, had been on the Sardinian steamer <i>Cagliari</i>
when she was seized by the Neapolitan Government, and her crew, including the engineers,
imprisoned at Naples. At the instance of the Conservative Government, who
acted more vigorously than their predecessors had done, the engineers were released, and
&pound;3,000 paid to them as compensation.

<p class="ind">The Queen sends to Lord Derby a Memorandum on the
state of preparation of our Navy in case of a war, the importance
of attending to which she has again strongly felt when
the late vote of the House of Commons endangered the continuance
of the good understanding with France. The whole
tone of the Debate on the first night of the reassembly of
Parliament has shown again that there exists a great disposition
to boast and provoke foreign Powers without any
sincere desire to investigate our means of making good our
words, and providing for those means which are missing.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes Lord Derby to read this Memorandum
to the Cabinet, and to take the subject of which it treats
into their anxious consideration.</p>

<p class="ind">The two appendices, stating facts, the one with regard to
the manning of the Navy by volunteers with the aid of bounties,
the other with regard to impressment, have become
unfortunately more lengthy than the Queen had wished,

like to have any left out.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr B. Osborne commenced the general attack, of which
he had given notice; but, after five years' silence, his weapons
were not as bright as of yore. He was answered by the

much excited. The Ministerial benches were in high spirit.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Horsman, with considerable effect, expressed the opinions
of that portion of the Liberal Party, which does not wish to
disturb the Government.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell vindicated the Reform Bill of 1832 from
the attacks of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and with
great dignity and earnestness.</p>

<p class="ind">He was followed by Mr Drummond on the same subject in
a telling epigram. Then Lord Palmerston, in reply to the
charges of Mr Horsman, mild and graceful, with a sarcastic
touch. The general impression of the House was very favourable
to the Ministry; all seemed changed; the Debate had
cleared the political atmosphere, and, compared with our
previous state, we felt as if the eclipse was over.</p>

<p class="ind">House reassembled&mdash;full. Chancellor of Exchequer much
embarrassed with impending statement, on the part of your
Majesty's servants, that they intended to propose Resolutions
on the Government of India, instead of at once proceeding
with their Bill.<a id="footnotetagXXVII26" name="footnotetagXXVII26"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVII26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p class="ind">Received, five minutes before he took his seat, confidential
information, that Lord John Russell, wishing to defeat the
prospects of Lord Palmerston, and himself to occupy a great
mediatory position, intended, himself, to propose the mezzotermine
of resolutions!</p>

<p class="ind">Chancellor of Exchequer felt it was impossible, after having
himself introduced a Bill, to interfere with the Resolutions of
an independent member, and one so weighty and distinguished:
therefore, confined his announcement to the Budget on Monday
week, and consequent postponement of India Bill.</p>

<p class="ind">Soon after, Lord John rose, and opened the case, in a spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.280" id="pageiii.280"></a>[page&nbsp;280]</span>
most calm and conciliatory to the House, and to your Majesty's
Government.</p>

<p class="ind">The Chancellor of Exchequer responded, but with delicacy,
not wishing rudely to deprive Lord John of his position in the
matter; deeming it arrogant&mdash;but the real opposition, extremely
annoyed at all that was occurring, wishing, at the
same time, to deprive Lord John of the mediatory position,
and to embarrass your Majesty's Government with the task
and responsibility of preparing and introducing the resolutions,
<i>insisted</i> upon Government undertaking the task. As the
Chancellor of Exchequer read the sketch of the Resolutions
in his box, this was amusing; he undertook the responsibility,
thus urged, and almost menaced; Lord John, though greatly
mortified at not bringing in the Resolutions himself, for it is
since known they were prepared, entirely and justly acquits
Chancellor of Exchequer of any arrogance and intrusion, and
the affair concludes in a manner dignified and more than
promising. It is now generally supposed that after the various
Resolutions have been discussed, and passed, the Bill of your
Majesty's servants, modified and reconstructed, will pass
into a law.</p>

<p class="ind">The Chancellor of Exchequer will have a copy of the
Resolutions, though at present in a crude form, made and
forwarded to your Majesty, that they may be considered
by your Majesty and His Royal Highness. Chancellor of
Exchequer will mention this to Lord Derby, through whom
they ought to reach your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">After this unexpected and interesting scene, because it
showed, in its progress, a marked discordance between Lord
John and Lord Palmerston, not concealed by the latter chief,
and strongly evinced by some of his principal followers, for
example, Sir C. Wood, Mr Hall, Mr Bouverie, the House went
into Committee on the Navy Estimates which Sir J. Pakington
introduced in a speech, lucid, spirited, and comprehensive.

Canning, and the despatch thereon of Lord Ellenborough,
without the omission of the Oudh passages.<sup>28</sup></p>

to recall the papers, and make the necessary omissions, and
more than once thought he had succeeded, but unhappily the

number of members, and, had papers once in the possession
of the House by the presentation of a Minister been surreptitiously
recalled and garbled, the matter would have been
brought before the House, and the production of the complete
documents would have been ordered.</p>

Vernon Smith, then President of the Board, stating that he had not been able to find time
before the mail left to explain his reasons for adopting what appeared a somewhat merciless
scheme of confiscation. Lord Ellenborough thereupon wrote a despatch, dated the
19th of April, reprobating the Governor-General for abandoning the accustomed policy
of generous conquerors, and for inflicting on the mass of the population what they would
feel as the severest of punishments. This despatch was made public in England, as will
be seen from the dates, before it could possibly have reached Lord Canning.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Eaton Square</span>, <i>10th May 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Ellenborough presents his most humble duty to your

to Parliament of the letter to the Governor-General with
reference to the Proclamation in Oudh, for which step he

<span class="rightnote">A CRISIS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>11th May 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby had an Audience at twelve o'clock. He said
he had received a copy of Lord Ellenborough's letter, and had
told him that should the Queen consult him (Lord Derby) he
should advise her to accept the resignation, Lord Ellenborough
had behaved in the handsomest manner, and expressed his
belief that he had brought bad luck to the Government, for
this was now the second difficulty into which they had got by
his instrumentality, the first having been the Election Clause
in the India Bill. Lord Derby hoped that this resignation
would stop the vote of censure in the House of Commons, as
the House could not hold responsible and punish the Cabinet
for that with which they had had no concern. If the House
persisted, it was clear that the motives were factious, and he
hoped the Queen would allow him to threaten a Dissolution of
Parliament, which he was certain would stop it. The Queen
refused to give that permission; she said he might leave it
quite undecided whether the Queen would grant a Dissolution
or not, and take the benefit of the doubt in talking to others on
the subject; but she must be left quite free to act as she
thought the good of the country might require at the time
when the Government should have been beat; there had
been a Dissolution within the year, and if a Reform Bill was
passed there must be another immediately upon it; in the
meantime most violent pledges would be taken as to Reform
if a general election were to take place now. Lord Derby concurred
in all this, and said he advised the threat particularly
in order to render the reality unnecessary; when she persisted
in her refusal, however, on the ground that she could
not threaten what she was not prepared to do, he appeared
very much disappointed and mortified.</p>

<p class="ind">We then discussed the state of the question itself, and urged
the necessity of something being done to do away with the
injurious impression which the publication of the despatch
must produce in India, as the resignation of Lord Ellenborough
left this quite untouched, and Parliament might with justice
demand this. He agreed, after much difficulty, to send a
telegraphic despatch, which might overtake and mitigate the
other. On my remark that the public were under the impression
that there had been collusion, and that Mr Bright had
seen the despatch before he asked his question for its production,
he denied this stoutly, but let us understand that Mr
Bright had known of the existence of such a despatch, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.284" id="pageiii.284"></a>[page&nbsp;284]</span>
had wished to put his question before, but had been asked to
defer it until Lord Canning's Proclamation should have appeared
in the newspapers! (This is nearly as bad!!) The
Queen could not have pledged herself to dissolve Parliament
in order to support such tricks!</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty
the expression of his hope that the discussion, or rather conversation,
which has taken place in the House of Lords this
evening, may have been not only advantageous to the Government,
but beneficial in its results to the public service....</p>

<p class="ind">After the discussion, Lord Ellenborough made his statement;
and it is only doing bare justice to him to say that he
made it in a manner and spirit which was most highly honourable
to himself, and was fully appreciated by the House.</p>

<p class="ind">Public sympathy was entirely with him, especially when he
vindicated the policy which he had asserted, but took upon
himself the whole and sole responsibility of having authorised
the publication of the despatch&mdash;which he vindicated&mdash;and
announced his own resignation rather than embarrass his
colleagues. Lord Grey shortly entered his protest against
bringing into discussion the policy of the Proclamation and of
the consequent despatch, into which Lord Ellenborough had
certainly entered too largely, opposing, very broadly, the
principle of confiscation against that of clemency. Lord Derby
followed Lord Grey, and after an interruption on a point of
form, vindicated the policy advocated in Lord Ellenborough's
despatch, at the same time that he expressed not only his hope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.285" id="pageiii.285"></a>[page&nbsp;285]</span>
but his belief, that in practice the Governor-General would be
found (and more especially judging from the alterations inserted
in the last Proclamation of which an unofficial copy has
been received) acting on the principles laid down in Lord
Ellenborough's despatch. In the tribute which he felt it his
duty to pay to the personal, as well as political, character of
Lord Ellenborough, the House concurred with entire unanimity
and all did honour to the spirit which induced him to sacrifice
his own position to the public service; and to atone, and
more than atone, for an act of indiscretion by the frank avowal
that he alone was responsible for it. Lord Derby thinks
that the step which has been taken may, even probably, prevent
the Motions intended to be made on Friday; and if
made, will, almost certainly, result in a majority for the
Government.</p>
<span class="rightnote">LORD DERBY'S DESPATCH</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Derby believes that he may possibly be in time to
telegraph to Malta early to-morrow, to Lord Canning. In that
case he will do himself the honour of submitting to your Majesty
a copy of the message<sup>31</sup> sent, though he fears it will be impossible
to do so before its despatch. He proposes in substance
to say that the publication has been disapproved&mdash;that Lord
Ellenborough has resigned in consequence&mdash;but that your
Majesty's Government adhere in principle to the policy laid
down in the despatch of 19th April, and entertain an earnest
hope that the Governor-General, judging from the modifications
introduced into the amended Proclamation, has, in fact,
the intention of acting in the same spirit; but that your
Majesty's Government are still of opinion that confiscation
of private property ought to be made the exception, and not
the rule, and to be enforced only against those who may stand
out after a certain day, or who may be proved to have been
guilty of more than ordinary crimes.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby hopes that your Majesty will excuse a very
hasty sketch of a very large subject.</p>

<p class="note1">The publication of the Secret Despatch of 19th April has been disapproved. Lord
Ellenborough has resigned office. His successor has not been appointed. Nevertheless
the policy indicated in the above despatch is approved by Her Majesty's Government.
Confiscation of property of private individuals (Talookdars and others) ought to be the
exception and not the rule. It ought to be held out as a penalty on those who do not
come in by a given day. From your amended Proclamation it is hoped that such is your
intention. Let it be clearly understood that it is so. You were quite right in issuing
no Proclamation till after a signal success. That once obtained, the more generous the
terms, the better. A broad distinction must be drawn between the Talookdars of Oudh
and the Sepoys who have been in our service. Confidence is felt in your judgment.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><i>14th May 1858.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the extracts Lord Derby has sent to her.
Lord Ellenborough's despatch,<sup>32</sup> now before her for the first
time, is very good and just in principle. But the Queen would
be much surprised if it did not entirely coincide with the views
of Lord Canning, at least as far as he has hitherto expressed
any in his letters. So are also the sentiments written by Sir
J. Lawrence; they contain almost the very expressions
frequently used by Lord Canning.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir J. Login,<sup>33</sup> who holds the same opinion, and has great
Indian experience, does not find any fault with the Proclamation,
however seemingly it may sound at variance with these
opinions, and this on account of the peculiar position of affairs
in Oudh. It is a great pity that Lord Ellenborough, with his
knowledge, experience, activity, and cleverness, should be so
entirely unable to submit to general rules of conduct. The
Queen has been for some time much alarmed at his writing
letters of his own to all the most important Indian Chiefs
and Kings explaining his policy. All this renders the position
of a Governor-General almost untenable, and that of the
Government at home very hazardous.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD ABERDEEN CONSULTED</span>

<p class="indright">[<i>Undated.</i> ? <i>15th May 1858.</i>]</p>

<p class="ind">Upon being admitted to Lord Aberdeen, I informed him
that the Queen and Prince were anxious to hear his opinion
upon the present most unfortunate state of affairs, but that,
knowing how easily every event was perverted in such times as
the present, Her Majesty and His Royal Highness had thought
that it might have been subject to misapprehension had he
been known to have been at Buckingham Palace, and
that I had been therefore directed to call upon him, with a
view of obtaining his opinion and advice upon certain important
points.</p>
<span class="rightnote">PREROGATIVE OF DISSOLUTION</span>
<p class="ind">The first was the question of a Dissolution of Parliament in
the event of the Government being defeated upon the question
which was at present pending. I told him that I was permitted
to communicate to him in the strictest confidence, that
in a late Audience which Lord Derby had with the Queen, he
had asked her permission to be allowed to announce that, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.287" id="pageiii.287"></a>[page&nbsp;287]</span>
the event of an adverse majority, he had Her Majesty's sanction
to a Dissolution of Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">That the Queen had declined to give such sanction, or even
such a pledge, and equally guarded herself against being supposed
to have made up her mind to refuse her sanction to a
Dissolution, had told Lord Derby that she could not then make
any prospective decision upon the subject. I told him that
in point of fact Her Majesty was disinclined to grant to Lord
Derby her authority for a Dissolution, but that the Queen
had at once refused to grant to Lord Derby her sanction for
making the announcement he wished, as she considered that
it would be a very unconstitutional threat for him to hold
over the head of the Parliament, with her authority, by way
of biassing their decision.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen interrupted me by saying that the Queen
had done quite right&mdash;that he never heard of such a request
being made, or authority for such an announcement being
sought&mdash;and he could not at all understand Lord Derby
making such an application. He knew that the Government
had threatened a Dissolution, that he thought that they had a
perfect right to do so, but that they would have been quite
wrong in joining the Queen's name with it.</p>

<p class="ind">He said that he had never entertained the slightest doubt that
if the Minister advised the Queen to dissolve, she would, as a
matter of course, do so. The Minister who advised the Dissolution
took upon himself the heavy responsibility of doing so,
but that the Sovereign was bound to suppose that the person
whom she had appointed as a Minister was a gentleman and an
honest man, and that he would not advise Her Majesty to take
such a step unless he thought that it was for the good of the
country. There was no doubt of the power and prerogative of
the Sovereign to refuse a Dissolution&mdash;it was one of the very
few acts which the Queen of England could do without responsible
advice at the moment; but even in this case
whoever was sent for to succeed, must, with his appointment,
assume the responsibility of this act, and be prepared to defend
it in Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">He could not remember a single instance in which the undoubted
power of the Sovereign had been exercised upon this
point, and the advice of the Minister to dissolve Parliament
had been rejected&mdash;for it was to be remembered that Lord
Derby would be still at this time her Minister&mdash;and that the
result of such refusal would be that the Queen would take
upon herself the act of dismissing Lord Derby from office, instead
of his resigning from being unable longer to carry on
the Government.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.288" id="pageiii.288"></a>[page&nbsp;288]</span>

<p class="ind">The Queen had during her reign, and throughout the numerous
changes of Government, maintained an unassailable
position of constitutional impartiality, and he had no hesitation
in saying that he thought it would be more right, and
certainly more safe, for her to follow the usual course, than to
take this dangerous time for exercising an unusual and, he
believed he might say, an unprecedented, course, though the
power to exercise the authority was undoubted.</p>

<p class="ind">He said that he did not conceive that any reasons of expediency
as to public business, or the possible effects of frequent
general elections, would be sufficient grounds for refusing a
Dissolution (and reasons would have to be given by the new
Minister in Parliament), and, as he conceived, the only possible
ground that could be maintained as foundation for such an
exercise of authority would be the fearful danger to the existence
of our power in India, which might arise from the intemperate
discussion upon every hustings of the proceedings
of the Government with respect to that country&mdash;as the question
proposed to the country would certainly be considered
to be severity or mercy to the people of India.</p>

<p class="ind">Upon the second point, as to a successor to Lord Derby in
the event of his resignation, he said that the Queen would, he
thought, have no alternative but to send for Lord Palmerston.
The only other person who could be suggested would be Lord
John Russell, and he was neither the mover of the Resolutions
which displaced the Government, nor the ostensible head of
the Opposition, which the late meeting at Cambridge House
pointed out Lord Palmerston to be. That he was not very
fond of Lord Palmerston, though he had forgiven him all, and
he had had <i>much</i> to forgive; and that in the last few days it
had appeared that he had less following than Lord John; but
the Queen could not act upon such daily changing circumstances,
and it was evident that Lord Palmerston was the
ostensible man for the Queen to send for.</p>
<span class="rightnote">STATE OF PARTIES</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen seemed very low upon the state of public
affairs. He said that the extreme Liberals were the only Party
that appeared to gain strength. Not only was the Whig Party
divided within itself, hated by the Radicals, and having a very
doubtful support from the independent Liberals, but even the
little band called the Peelites had entirely crumbled to pieces.
In the House of Lords, whilst the Duke of Newcastle voted
with the Opposition, he (Lord Aberdeen) had purposely abstained
from voting, whilst, in the House of Commons, Cardwell
moved the Resolution, and Mr Sidney Herbert would, he
believed, vote for it; Gladstone would speak on the other side,
and Sir J. Graham would also vote with the Government.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.289" id="pageiii.289"></a>[page&nbsp;289]</span>

<p class="ind">He concluded by saying that if the majority against the
Government was a very large one, he thought that Lord Derby
ought not to ask to dissolve; but that he knew that the
members of the Government had said that the present Parliament
was elected upon a momentary Palmerstonian cry, and
was quite an exceptional case, and that they would not consent
to be driven from office upon its verdict.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN AND DISSOLUTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>16th May 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">We saw Lord Derby after church. He brought interesting
letters from Lord Canning to Lord Ellenborough, of which
copies follow here. It is evident that Lord Canning thinks
that he is taking a most merciful course, and expects pacification
from his "Proclamation," attributing the slow coming in of
the chiefs to the Proclamation not being yet sufficiently known.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Ellenborough's, and indeed the Government's, hearts,
must have had curious sensations in reading Lord Canning's
frank declaration, that he did not mean to resign on hearing
of the formation of the Tory Government unless told to do so,
and he had no fears that he would be treated in a way implying
want of confidence to make him resign, feeling safe as to that
in Lord Ellenborough's hands!</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby spoke much of the Debate, which he expects to
go on for another week. He expects to be beaten by from
15 to 35 votes under present circumstances, but thinks still
that he could be saved if it were known that the Queen had not
refused a Dissolution, which was stoutly maintained by Lord
Palmerston's friends. He begged again to be empowered to
contradict the assertion. The Queen maintained that it would
be quite unconstitutional to threaten Parliament, and to use
her name for that purpose. Lord Derby quite agreed, and disclaimed
any such intention, but said there were modes of
letting the fact be known without any risk. We agreed that
we could not enter into such details. The Queen allowed him
(Lord Derby) to know that a Dissolution would not be refused
to him, and trusted that her honour would be safe in his hands
as to the use he made of that knowledge. He seemed greatly
relieved, and stated that had he had to resign, he would have
withdrawn from public business, and the Conservative Party
would have been entirely, and he feared for ever, broken up.
On a Dissolution he felt certain of a large gain, as the country
was in fact tired of the "Whig Family Clique"; the Radicals,
like Mr Milner Gibson, Bright, etc., would willingly support
a Conservative Government.</p>

Mr Gladstone was to have spoken for the Government at
half-past ten&mdash;very great excitement&mdash;when there occurred
a scene perhaps unprecedented in Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">One after another, perhaps twenty Members, on the Opposition
benches, rising and entreating Mr Cardwell to withdraw
his Resolution. After some time, silence on the Government
benches, Mr Cardwell went to Lord John Russell, then to Lord
Palmerston, then to Lord John Russell again, then returned to
Lord Palmerston, and retired with him.</p>

<p class="ind">What are called the interpellations continued, when suddenly
Lord Palmerston reappeared; embarrassed, with a faint smile;
addressed the House; and after various preluding, announced
the withdrawal of the Motion of Censure.</p>

<p class="ind">A various Debate followed; the Chancellor of the Exchequer
endeavouring, as far as regards Lord Canning, to fulfil
your Majesty's wishes. It is impossible to estimate the importance
of this unforeseen event to your Majesty's servants.
It has strengthened them more than the most decided division
in their favour, for it has revealed complete anarchy in the
ranks of their opponents. With prudence and vigilance all
must now go right.</p>

<p class="ind">The speech of Sir James Graham last night produced a very
great effect. No report gives a fair idea of it. The great
country gentleman, the broad views, the fine classical allusions,
the happiest all omitted, the massy style, contrasted remarkably
with Sir Richard Bethell.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 34: Lord Shaftesbury's Motion in the Lords had been lost by a majority of nine. In
the Commons, Mr Cardwell was replied to in a brilliant speech by Sir Hugh Cairns, the
Solicitor-General. The speeches of Sir James Graham, Mr Bright, and others, showed
that the Opposition was disunited, and when it was understood that Mr Gladstone would
support the Ministry, the Liberal attack collapsed. Mr Disraeli, deprived of the satisfaction
of making an effective reply, subsequently compared the discomfiture of his opponents
to an earthquake in Calabria or Peru. "There was," he said, in the course of
a speech at Slough, "a rumbling murmur, a groan, a shriek, a sound of distant thunder.
No one knew whether it came from the top or bottom of the House. There was a rent,
a fissure in the ground, and then a village disappeared, then a tall tower toppled down,
and the whole of the Opposition benches became one great dissolving view of anarchy."

<p class="rindent1">(<i>Sunday night.</i>)</p>


<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, gratefully acknowledges
your Majesty's gracious letter just received, and the telegraphic
message with which he was honoured in answer to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.291" id="pageiii.291"></a>[page&nbsp;291]</span>
on Friday night. Your Majesty can hardly be expected to
estimate, at a distance from the immediate scene of action, the
effect of the event of that evening. It was the utter explosion
of a well-constructed mine, under the feet, not of the
assailed, but of the assailants; and the effect has been the
greater from the immense attendance in London of Members
of the House of Commons. No effort had been spared. Lord
Castlerosse, only just married, had been sent for from Italy&mdash;but
Lord Derby hopes that he had not been induced to come&mdash;for
nothing. It is said that of the 654 Members of whom
the House is composed, 626 were actually in London. The
Government could rely on 304 to 308, and the whole question
turned on the absence, or the conversion, of a small number of
"Liberal" Members. The result is to be attributed to two
causes; first, and principally, to the fear of a Dissolution, and
to the growing conviction that in case of necessity your Majesty
would sanction such a course, which had been strenuously
denied by Lord Palmerston&mdash;and in which Lord Derby hopes
that your Majesty will have seen that your Majesty's name has
never, for a moment, been brought in question; and secondly,
to the effect produced by the correspondence between the
Governor-General and Sir James Outram.<a id="footnotetagXXVII35" name="footnotetagXXVII35"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVII35"><sup>35</sup></a> And here Lord
Derby may perhaps be allowed the opportunity of removing
a misconception from your Majesty's mind, as to any secret
intelligence or underhand intrigue between Lord Ellenborough
and Sir James Outram, to the detriment of Lord Canning.
Lord Derby is in the position to know that if there is one
person in the world to whom Lord Ellenborough has an utter
aversion, and with whom he has no personal or private correspondence,
it is Sir James Outram. Anything therefore in
common in their opinions must be the result of circumstances
wholly irrespective of private concert. Lord Derby has
written fully to Lord Canning, privately, by the mail which
will go out on Tuesday; and while he has not concealed from
him the opinion of your Majesty's servants that the Proclamation,
of which so much has been said, conveyed too sweeping an
Edict of Confiscation against the landowners, great and small,
of Oudh, he has not hesitated to express also his conviction that
Lord Canning's real intentions, in execution, would not be
found widely to differ from the views of your Majesty's servants.
He has expressed to Lord Canning his regret at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.292" id="pageiii.292"></a>[page&nbsp;292]</span>
premature <i>publication</i> of the Draft Proclamation, at the same
time that he has pointed out the injustice done both to your
Majesty's Government and to the Governor-General by the
(Lord Derby will hardly call it fraudulent) suppression of the
private letters addressed to the President of the Board of Control,
and deprecating judgment on the text of the Proclamation,
until explanation should be received. Lord Derby
cannot but be of opinion that this suppression, of which Lord
Palmerston was fully cognisant, was an act which no political
or party interests were sufficient to justify.</p>
<span class="rightnote">OFFER TO MR GLADSTONE</span>
<p class="ind">The state of the Government, during the late crisis, was such
as to render it impossible to make any arrangement for filling
up Lord Ellenborough's place at the Board of Control. Application
has since been made to Mr Gladstone,<sup>36</sup> with the
offer of that post, or of that of the Colonial Department,
which Lord Stanley would give up for the convenience of your
Majesty's Government, though unwillingly, for India. Mr
Gladstone demurred, on the ground of not wishing to leave
his friends; but when pressed to name whom he would wish
to bring with him, he could name none. Finally, he has
written to ask advice as to his course of Sir James Graham,
who has returned to Netherby, and of Lord Aberdeen; and
by them he will probably be guided. Should he finally
refuse, Lord Stanley <i>must</i> take India; and the Colonies must
be offered in the first instance to Sir E. B. Lytton, who probably
will refuse, as he wants a Peerage, and is doubtful of
his re-election; and failing him, to Sir William Heathcote,
the Member for the University of Oxford, who, without
official experience, has great Parliamentary knowledge and
influence, and, if he will accept, is quite equal to the duties
of the office. Lord Derby trusts that your Majesty will
forgive this long intrusion on your Majesty's patience. He
has preferred the risk of it, to leaving your Majesty
uninformed as to anything which was going on, or contemplated....</p>

<p class="ind">If Lord Dalhousie should be in a state to converse upon
public affairs, there is no one with whom Lord Derby could
confer more confidentially than with him; nor of whose
judgment, though he regrets to differ with him as to the
annexation of Oudh, he has a higher opinion. He will
endeavour to ascertain what is his present state of health,
which he fears is very unsatisfactory, and will see and
converse with him, if possible.</p>

small number of Members in the House when the division took pace, and the bare majority
by which the decision was arrived at, Her Majesty's Government do not feel that
it is their duty to recommend any measure in consequence of that resolution."

It is, the Chancellor of the Exchequer really thinks,

of an imperial palace; and your Majesty would do
well to deign to consider the steps which are now necessary

<span class="rightnote">INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>8th July 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen in reading in the papers yesterday, on her way
here from the camp, the Debate in the House of Commons of the
previous night, was shocked to find that in several important
points her Government have surrendered the prerogatives<span class="rightnote">THE SOVEREIGN'S PREROGATIVES</span>
of the Crown. She will only refer to the clauses concerning
the Indian Civil Service and the right of peace and war.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the first, the regulations under which
servants of the Crown are to be admitted or examined have
always been an undoubted right and duty of the Executive;
by the clause introduced by Lord Stanley the system of "Competitive
Examination" has been confirmed by Act of Parliament.
That system may be right or wrong; it has since its
introduction been carried on under the Orders in Council;
now the Crown and Government are to be deprived of any
authority in the matter, and the whole examinations, selection,
and appointments, etc., etc., are to be vested in the Civil
Commissioners under a Parliamentary title.</p>

<p class="ind">As to the right of the Crown to declare war and make peace,
it requires not a word of remark; yet Lord Stanley agrees to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.295" id="pageiii.295"></a>[page&nbsp;295]</span>
Mr Gladstone's proposal to make over this prerogative with
regard to Indian questions to Parliament under the auspices
of the Queen's Government; she is thus placed in a position
of less authority than the President of the American Republic.<sup>41</sup></p>

<p class="ind">When a Bill has been introduced into Parliament, after
having received the Sovereign's approval, she has the right
to expect that her Ministers will not subsequently introduce
important alterations without previously obtaining her sanction.
In the first of the two instances referred to by the
Queen, Lord Stanley introduced the alteration himself; in
the second he agreed to it even without asking for a moment's
delay; and the Opposition party, which attempted to guard
the Queen's prerogative, was overborne by the Government
Leader of the House.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must remind Lord Derby that it is to him as the
head of the Government that she looks for the protection of
those prerogatives which form an integral part of the Constitution.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 41: An important amendment made at the instance of Mr Gladstone provided that,
except for repelling actual invasion or upon urgent necessity, the Queen's Indian forces
should not be employed in operations outside India, without Parliamentary sanction.

If the name of New Caledonia is objected to as being already
borne by another colony or island claimed by the French, it

The only name which is given to the whole territory in every

exists also a Columbia in South America, and the citizens of
the United States call their country also Columbia, at least in
poetry, "British Columbia" might be, in the Queen's opinion,

<span class="rightnote">ARMY COMMISSIONS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>29th July 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has been placed in a most unpleasant dilemma
by the last vote in the House of Commons;<sup>45</sup> she feels all
the force of Lord Derby's objections to risking another defeat
on the same question and converting the struggle into one
against the Royal Prerogative; yet, on the other hand, she
can hardly sit still, and from mere want of courage become
a party to the most serious inroad which has yet been made
upon it. It is the introduction of the principle into our legislation
that the Sovereign is no longer the source of all appointments
under the Crown, but that these appointments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.297" id="pageiii.297"></a>[page&nbsp;297]</span>
are the property of individuals under a Parliamentary title,
which the Queen feels bound to resist. Lord John Russell's
Motion and Sir James Graham's speech only went to the
Civil appointments; but after their Motion had been carried
on a division, Lord Stanley gave way to Sir De Lacy Evans
also with regard to a <i>portion of the Army!</i> If this principle is
recognised and sanctioned by the entire legislature, its future
extension can no longer be resisted on constitutional grounds,
and Lord John in fact reminded Lord Stanley that the latter
had stated that he only refrained from making the application
general from thinking it <i>premature</i>, himself being of
opinion that it ought to be carried further, and yet its extension
to the Army reduces the Sovereign to a mere signing
machine, as, to carry the case to its extreme consequence,
<i>Law</i> would <i>compel</i> her to sign the Commission for the officers,
and they might have the right to sue at law for the recovery
of their property vested in them by Act of Parliament (viz.,
their Commissions) if the Crown doubted for any reason the
fitness of an appointment!! Have these consequences been
considered and brought distinctly before Parliament? It
strikes the Queen that all the Commons want is a Parliamentary
security against the abolition of the Competitive System of
Examinations by the Executive. Can this not be obtained
by means less subversive of the whole character of our Constitution?
The Queen cannot believe that Lord Derby could
not find means to come to some agreement with the Opposition,
and she trusts he will leave nothing undone to effect this.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 45: The Lords Amendments on the subject of competitive examination were rejected
by a majority of thirteen in the Commons, and, in the circumstances, Lord Derby had
advised abiding by the decision and not risking another defeat.

<span class="rightnote">NAVAL ESTIMATES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>2nd August 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen feels it her duty to address a few lines to Lord
Derby on the subject of the reports made to Sir John Pakington
on the subject of the French Naval preparations, to which
she has already verbally adverted when she saw Lord Derby
last. These reports reveal a state of things of the greatest
moment to this country. It will be the first time in her history
that she will find herself in an absolute minority of ships on
the sea! and this inferiority will be much greater in reality
than even apparent, as our fleet will have to defend possessions
and commerce all over the world, and has even in Europe a
strategical line to hold extending from Malta to Heligoland,
whilst France keeps her fleet together and occupies the centre
of that line in Europe.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thinks it irreconcilable with the duty which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.298" id="pageiii.298"></a>[page&nbsp;298]</span>
Government owes to the country to be aware of this state of
things without straining every nerve to remedy it. With
regard to men in whom we are also totally deficient in case
of an emergency, a Commission of Enquiry is sitting to devise
a remedy; but with regard to our ships and dockyards we
require action, and immediate action. The plan proposed by
the Surveyor of the Navy appears to the Queen excessively
moderate and judicious, and she trusts that the Cabinet will
not hesitate to empower its execution, bearing in mind that
&pound;200,000 spent now will probably do more work during the
six or nine months for working before us, than &pound;2,000,000
would if voted in next year's estimate, letting our arrears in
the dockyards, already admitted to be very great, accumulate
in the interval. Time is most precious under these circumstances!</p>

<p class="ind">It is true that this sum of money would be in excess of the
estimates of last Session, but the Queen feels sure that on the
faith of the reports made by the Admiralty, the Government
would find no difficulty in convincing Parliament that they
have been good stewards of the public money, in taking
courageously the responsibility upon themselves to spend
judiciously what is necessary, and that the country will be
deeply grateful for the honesty with which they will have
served her.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes Lord Derby to communicate this letter
to the Cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has asked Lord Malmesbury to explain in detail
to Lord Derby her objections to the draft of Proclamation
for India. The Queen would be glad if Lord Derby would
write it himself in his excellent language, bearing in mind
that it is a female Sovereign who speaks to more than
100,000,000 of Eastern people on assuming the direct Government
over them after a bloody civil war, giving them pledges
which her future reign is to redeem, and explaining the principles
of her Government. Such a document should breathe
feelings of generosity, benevolence, and religious feeling, pointing
out the privileges which the Indians will receive in being
placed on an equality with the subjects of the British Crown,
and the prosperity following in the train of civilisation.<sup>46</sup></p>

Lord Stanley seemed anxious to defer a settlement on this

<span class="rightnote">LORD PALMERSTON</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>4th September 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The most remarkable feature of the last Session of Parliament
has been the extraordinary unpopularity of Lord
Palmerston, for which nothing can account; the only direct
reproach which is made to him, is to have appointed Lord
Clanricarde Privy Seal, and to have been overbearing in his
manner. Yet a House of Commons, having been elected
solely for the object, and on the ground of supporting Lord
Palmerston personally (an instance in our Parliamentary
history without parallel), holds him suddenly in such abhorrence,
that not satisfied with having upset his Government,
which had been successful in all its policy, and thrown him
out, it will hardly listen to him when he speaks. He is frequently
received with hooting, and throughout the last Session
it sufficed that [he] took up any cause for the whole House
voting against it, even if contrary to the principles which
they had themselves advocated, merely to have the satisfaction
of putting him into a minority. How can this be
accounted for? The man who was without rhyme or reason
stamped the only <i>English</i> statesman, the champion of liberty,
the man of the people, etc., etc., now, without his having
changed in any one respect, having still the same virtues
and the same faults that he always had, young and vigorous
in his seventy-fifth year, and having succeeded in his policy,
is now considered the head of a clique, the man of intrigue,
past his work, etc., etc.&mdash;in fact hated! and this throughout
the country. I cannot explain the enigma except by supposing
that people had before joined in a cry which they
thought was popular without themselves believing what they
said and wrote, and that they now do the same; that the
Radicals used his name to destroy other statesmen and politicians,
and are destroying him now in his turn; that they
hoped to govern through him, and that they see a better
chance now of doing it through a weak and incapable Tory
Government which has entered into a secret bargain for their
support. Still the phenomenon remains most curious.<sup>49</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 49: Charles Greville, in his Journal (16th June 1858), noted the same
circumstance,
and drew the inference that Palmerston's public career was drawing to a close.]</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Palmerston himself remains, outwardly at least, quite
cheerful, and seems to care very little about his reverses;
he speaks on all subjects, bids for the Liberal support as
before, even at the expense of his better conviction (as he
used to do), and keeps as much as possible before the public;
he made an official tour in Ireland, and is gone to visit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.301" id="pageiii.301"></a>[page&nbsp;301]</span>
Emperor Napoleon at Paris; his Chinese policy upon which
the general Dissolution had taken place in 1857 has just been
crowned by the most complete success by the advantageous
treaty signed at Pekin by Lord Elgin; and yet even for this
the public will not allow him any credit. Lady Palmerston,
on the contrary, is said to be very unhappy and very much
hurt.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Grosvenor Gate</span>, <i>18th November 1858</i>.</p>
<p class="rindent1">(<i>Wednesday night.</i>)</p>


<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;After the Committee of the Cabinet on the Reform
Bill, which sat this morning for five hours, Lord Stanley
expressed a wish to have some private conversation with me.</p>

<p class="ind">Although I would willingly have deferred the interview till
a moment when I was less exhausted, I did not think it wise,
with a person of his temperament, to baulk an occasion, and
therefore assented at once.</p>

<p class="ind">I give your Royal Highness faithfully, but feebly, and not
completely, the results of our conversation.</p>

<p class="ind">1. With respect to the relations between his office and Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.302" id="pageiii.302"></a>[page&nbsp;302]</span>
Majesty, he said he was conscious that they had been conducted
with great deficiency of form, and, in many respects,
in an unsatisfactory manner; but he attributed all this to
the inexperience and "sheer ignorance" of a Department
which had not been accustomed to direct communication
with the Crown. Some portion of this, he said, he had already
remedied, and he wished to remedy all, though he experienced
difficulties, on some of which he consulted me.</p>

<p class="ind">He accepted, without reserve, and cordially, my position,
that he must act always as the Minister of the Queen, and not
of the Council, but he said I took an exaggerated view of his
relations with that body; that he thoroughly knew their
respective places, and should be vigilant that they did [? not]
overstep their limits; that he had never been, of which he
reminded me, an admirer of the East India Company, and
had no intention of reviving their system; that the incident
of submitting the legal case to the Council, etc., had originated
in a demand on the part of the Commander-in-Chief, which
involved, if complied with, a grant of money, and that, under
these circumstances, an appeal to the Council was inevitable.</p>

<p class="ind">2. He agreed with me, that, on all military matters, he
would habitually communicate with the Commander-in-Chief,
and take His Royal Highness's advice on all such points;
and that copies of all military papers, as I understood Lord
Stanley, should be furnished to His Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="ind">3. Having arrived at this point, I laid before him the views
respecting <i>military unity</i>, which formed the subject matter
of recent conversations. Lord Stanley assented to the principles
which I attempted to enforce; and in reply to my
reminding him that the old military system of India had
entirely broken down, he said he contemplated terminating
the independent authority of the Commander-in-Chief at the
inferior Presidencies, and of establishing the absolute and
complete authority of Her Majesty's Commander-in-Chief in
India. He did not seem to see his way to any further step at
present, and I did not think it judicious on this occasion to
press the subject further.</p>

<p class="ind">Throughout this interview, Lord Stanley's manner was
candid, very conciliatory, and, for him, even soft. He was
pleased to say that it was a source of great satisfaction to
him that your Royal Highness had deigned to confer confidentially
with me on the subject, and make me, as it were,
a "Mediator" on matters which, he assured me with great
emphasis, had occasioned him an amount of anxiety almost
intolerable.</p>
<span class="rightnote">SUGGESTED RESIGNATION</span>
<p class="ind">He had recurred, in the course of this interview, to a suggestion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.303" id="pageiii.303"></a>[page&nbsp;303]</span>
which he had thrown out on Tuesday, viz. that the
difficulties of the position might be removed, or greatly
mitigated, by his retirement from the office, and accepting,
if his continuance in the Government was desirable, another
post. I therefore thought it best at once to point out to him
that such a course of proceeding would only aggravate all the
inconveniences and annoyances at present existing; that his
retirement would be the signal for exaggerated rumours and
factious machinations, and would have the most baneful effect
on the discussion in Parliament generally of all those military
topics with which we were threatened; that, far from being
satisfactory to Her Majesty and your Royal Highness, I was
convinced that the Queen and yourself would hear of such an
intention with regret.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Stanley ultimately adopted entirely this view of his
position, and he parted from me with an earnest expression
of his hope that the painful misconceptions which had prevailed
might at once, or at least in due course, entirely disappear.</p>

<p class="ind">This, Sir, is a very imperfect report of an important interview,
but, as I collected from Lord Stanley, that nothing was
really settled in his conference on Tuesday with Lord Derby
and the Lord Chancellor, I have thought it my duty, without
loss of time, to forward it to your Royal Highness, and have
the honour to remain, ever, Sir, your most obedient and
sincerely obliged Servant,</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Mr Disraeli</span>,&mdash;I am very much obliged to you
for your long letter after a Cabinet meeting of five hours, and
subsequent interview with Lord Stanley, whom I am much
pleased to hear you found so anxious to remedy the present
state of things. I am glad that you made it clear to him that
the Queen had never connected in her mind the objections
which she felt bound to take with anything personal, which
could be removed by Lord Stanley's relinquishing the Indian
Secretaryship. The difficulty would still remain to be solved,
only under additional complication and disadvantage. Lord
Derby told me to-day that he was drawing up a Memorandum
which, when seen by the Chancellor and Lord Stanley, was
to be submitted to the Queen. Ever yours truly,</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Stanley's letter entering into
the subject of the difficulties which have arisen in the conduct
of the new Indian Department. She had from the first foreseen
that it would not be an easy matter to bring the establishments
of the old Company's Government to fall into the
practice and usages of the Constitutional Monarchy, and was
therefore most anxious that distinct rules should be laid down
before the installation of the new Government, which unfortunately
was not done, but she trusts will now be devised
and adopted.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen most readily gives Lord Stanley credit for
every intention to remove the obstacles in the way of the
solution of these difficulties as far as he was able, but she
cannot but fear that the particular form in which the opinion
of the Law Officers has been asked, and the fact [that] the
eighteen members of the Council (all naturally wedded to a
system under which they were trained) were made parties to
the discussion between herself and her Secretary of State on
these difficulties&mdash;must increase instead of diminishing them.</p>

<p class="ind">The account given by Mr Temple, together with the last
printed letters and Memoranda from the Punjab, give us
serious cause of apprehension for the future, and show that
the <i>British</i> Army is the only safeguard at present.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen acknowledges the receipt of Lord Canning's
letter of the 19th October, which she received on the 29th
November, which has given her great pleasure.</p>

<p class="ind">It is a source of great satisfaction and pride to her to feel
herself in direct communication with that enormous Empire
which is so bright a jewel of her Crown, and which she would
wish to see happy, contented, and peaceful. May the publication
of her Proclamation be the beginning of a new era, and
may it draw a veil over the sad and bloody past!</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen rejoices to hear that her Viceroy approves this
passage about Religion.<sup>52</sup> She strongly insisted on it. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.305" id="pageiii.305"></a>[page&nbsp;305]</span>
trusts also that the certainty of the Amnesty remaining open
till the 1st January may not be productive of serious evil.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must express our admiration of Lord Canning's
own Proclamation, the wording of which is beautiful. The
telegram received to-day brings continued good news, and
announces her proclamation having been read, and having
produced a good effect.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes to hear from Lord Canning, whenever
he can spare time to write. She misses hearing from Lady
Canning, not having heard from her since the 30th August;
but the Queen fears that she is herself to blame, as she has
not written to Lady Canning for a long time; she intends
doing so by the next mail....</p>

<p class="ind">Both the Prince and herself hope that Lord Canning's
health is now perfectly good, as well as dear Lady Canning's.
We ask him to remember us to her, and also to Lord Clyde.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen concludes with every wish for Lord Canning's
success and prosperity, and with the assurance of her undiminished
and entire confidence.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 51: The Queen's Proclamation to her Indian subjects had been received by Lord Canning
on the 17th of October, when he also learned that the title of Viceroy was in future to
dignify the Governor-General's office.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 52: "Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with
gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and desire to impose our
convictions on any of our subjects." The Proclamation proceeded to state that all the
Queen's Indian subjects should be impartially protected by the law, and live unmolested
in the observance of their several religions.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>10th December 1858</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Earl of Malmesbury presents his humble duty to the
Queen, and has already anticipated your Majesty's wishes
respecting the Emperor Napoleon.<sup>53</sup> Lord Malmesbury has
written to Lord Cowley a private letter, desiring him to show
it to His Majesty. It is in the same sense as your Majesty's,
and states that if he is anxious to improve the lot of the worst
governed country, namely the Papal States, he should, instead
of sulking with Austria, make an attempt with his Catholic
brother to ameliorate the Papal Government. It is not for
Protestant England to take the initiative, as her object would
be misunderstood and attributed to sectarian motives; but
England could give her moral support, and even her material
aid <i>eventually</i>, if it were required to establish an improved
Administration of the Roman States. Austria would gain by
having a quiet frontier. The correspondence which took place
in 1856 and 1857 between Lord Clarendon and Mr Lyons
shows that this is the only effective way of ameliorating the
condition of Italy without a war.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.306" id="pageiii.306"></a>[page&nbsp;306]</span>

<p class="ind">Lord Malmesbury thinks he can assure your Majesty that
none is at present contemplated by the Emperor Napoleon
(who has just contradicted the report officially), and Count
Buol is of the same opinion. The latter is constantly hurting
the vanity of the French Government by his irritable despatches,
and neither party makes the slightest effort to command
their temper; but it appears impossible that Napoleon
can make a <i>casus belli</i> against Austria. Besides this, your
Majesty may be assured that no warlike preparations are
making in France, such as must precede such a plan as an
Italian war.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Malmesbury entirely agrees with your Majesty that
it is desirable that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
should visit and remain at Rome incognito. It is also indispensable
that when there His Royal Highness should receive
no foreigner or stranger <i>alone</i>, so that no reports of pretended
conversations with such persons could be circulated without
immediate refutation by Colonel Bruce. Lord Malmesbury
will instruct Mr Odo Russell to inform His Holiness of your
Majesty's intentions in respect of the Prince.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 53: Viz. that the Emperor's mind should be diverted from his project of originating a
war in Italy. On the previous day Lord Malmesbury had written to the Queen: "Lord
Clarendon may have told your Majesty that the Emperor Napoleon was so ignorant of
the locality of Villafranca that he looked for it on the map in the Adriatic, and was
confounded when Lord Clarendon showed His Majesty that it was the Port of Nice and
ten miles from his frontier!"

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>


<p>Parliamentary Reform was the question of the hour at the
outset of the year 1859, and the Derby Government, though with
difficulty able to maintain itself in power, took the courageous step
of introducing a Reform Bill, the chief feature of which was the introduction
of a franchise based on personal property. Mr Walpole and
Mr Henley thereupon withdrew from the Ministry, and Lord John
Russell, from below the gangway, proposed an Amendment, protesting
against interference with the established freehold franchise, and
calling for a larger extension of the suffrage in towns. Lord Palmerston
and the Liberal Opposition supported the Amendment, while
Mr Gladstone, who was opposed to most of the provisions of the Bill,
supported it in preference to the Amendment, pleading, at the same
time, for the retention of the small boroughs. The Ministry were
defeated, and Parliament thereupon dissolved, but not until the civil
functionaries and all ranks of the native and European army had
received its thanks for the final suppression of the Indian Mutiny.
The Ministry gained twenty-five seats at the polls, but were still in
a minority, and as soon as it was known that Lord John Russell and
Lord Palmerston were reconciled, the end was in sight. A hostile
Amendment to the Address was carried by a majority of thirteen,
but on Lord Derby's resignation, the Queen was placed in a dilemma
by the competing claims of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell,
who had each been Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party.
Unwilling to be compelled to decide between them, she called upon
Lord Granville to form a Ministry representative of all sections of
the Liberal Party; but the difficulties proved insuperable, and Lord
Palmerston eventually formed a Ministry in which the Whigs, the
Peelites, and the Manchester School were all represented, though
Mr Cobden declined to join the Government. Mr Gladstone, who
had returned from the mission he had undertaken for the Derby
Cabinet, and voted with them in the critical division, became Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and kept his seat for Oxford University by
a majority of nearly two hundred.</p>

<p>The continent of Europe was the scene of a contest between Austria
on the one hand, who was struggling to maintain her position in Italy,
and France with Sardinia on the other. Sardinia, under the guidance
of Cavour, had joined the alliance of England and France against
Russia; and in July 1858 an interview at Plombi&egrave;res, under rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.308" id="pageiii.308"></a>[page&nbsp;308]</span>
mysterious circumstances, between Cavour and Louis Napoleon, led
to effective confederacy; a marriage, arranged or suggested at the
same time, between Princess Clothilde of Sardinia and a cousin of
the Emperor, brought the two illustrious houses still closer together.
In the spring of 1859, Sardinia prepared to take up arms to resist
Austrian predominance, and the assistance of the guerilla leader,
Garibaldi, was obtained. Count Cavour, in reply to interrogatories
from the British Government, stated officially his grievances against
Austria, while Lord Malmesbury despatched Lord Cowley on a
special mission to Vienna to mediate between Austria and France.
In April, however, after a curt summons to the Sardinians to disarm
had been disregarded, Austria invaded Piedmont, and Victor Emmanuel
placed himself at the head of his army. The first engagement
took place, with unfavourable results to the Austrians, at Montebello,
followed by French victories at Palestro and Magenta. A revolution
had meanwhile taken place in Florence. The Grand Duke had fled,
and a Commissioner to administer the affairs of the Grand Duchy had
been appointed by the King of Sardinia with the assent of the Tuscans,
who now joined the Franco-Sardinian alliance, while risings also took
place in Parma and Modena. The Austrians were again defeated
at Malegnano, and, on the 8th of June, the French Emperor and
King Victor Emmanuel entered Milan amid great enthusiasm. The
bloody action of Solferino was fought on the 24th of June, but on the
11th of July a treaty of peace was, somewhat unexpectedly, concluded
between the French and Austrian Emperors at Villafranca,
under which an Italian Confederation was to be erected, Lombardy
substantially ceded to Sardinia, the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the
Duke of Modena reinstated, and Venetia, though included in the
Confederation, to remain subject to the Imperial Crown of Austria;
these preliminaries were subsequently converted into a definite treaty
at Zurich. Meanwhile, the newly constituted representative Assemblies
in Tuscany, Romagna, and the Duchies, unanimously pronounced
for incorporation in the kingdom of Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<p>At home, on the 14th of October, the Queen opened the Glasgow
waterworks at the outflow of Loch Katrine, the construction of which
had necessitated engineering operations at that time considered
stupendous; a few days later an appalling shipping calamity
occurred, in the wreck of the <i>Royal Charter</i> near Anglesey, and the
loss of 459 lives.</p>

strength. The extraordinary exertions which France is making
in her Naval Department oblige us to exercise the utmost
vigour to keep up a superiority at sea, upon which our very
existence may be said to depend, and which would be already
lost at any moment that France were to be joined by any
other country possessing a Navy.<sup>2</sup> The war in India has
drained us of every available Battalion. We possess at this
moment only fourteen old Battalions of the Line within the
three kingdoms, and twelve Second Battalions newly raised,
whilst our Mediterranean possessions are under-garrisoned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.310" id="pageiii.310"></a>[page&nbsp;310]</span>
and Alderney has not as yet any garrison at all. Under these
circumstances the Queen has heard it rumoured that the
Government intend to propose a reduction on the estimates
of 9,000 men for this year. She trusts that such an idea, if
ever entertained, will upon reflection be given up as inconsistent
with the duty which the Government owe to the
country. Even if it were said that these 9,000 men have only
existed on paper, and have not yet been raised, such an act
at this moment would be indefensible; for it would require a
proof that circumstances have arisen which make it desirable
to ask for fewer troops than were considered requisite when
the last estimates were passed, which really cannot be said
to be the case! To be able to raise at any time an additional
9,000 men (in political danger) without having to go to Parliament
for a supplementary vote and spreading alarm thereby,
must be of the utmost value to the Government, and if not
wanted, the vote will entail no additional expense.</p>

<p class="ind">England will not be listened to in Europe, and be powerless
for the preservation of the general peace, which must be her
first object under the present circumstances, if she is known
to be despicably weak in her military resources, and no statesman
will, the Queen apprehends, maintain that if a European
war were to break out she could hope to remain long out of
it. For peace and for war, therefore, an available Army is
a necessity to her.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes Lord Derby to communicate this letter
to the Cabinet.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 2: The French Emperor had signalised the opening of a new year by an ominous speech.
To M. H&uuml;bner, the Austrian Ambassador at Paris, who had attended, with the other foreign
representatives, to offer the usual congratulations on the 1st of January, he observed:
"I regret that the relations between our two Governments are not more satisfactory;
but I beg you to assure the Emperor that they in no respect alter my feelings of friendship
to himself."

<h5>(<i>Submitted to Queen Victoria</i>.)</h5>


<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Rome</span>, <i>14th January 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I had the honour of being received by the Pope at a
private audience this morning at the Vatican. No one else
was present.</p>

<p class="ind">His Holiness, whose manner towards me was most kind and
benevolent, said: "You are appointed to succeed a very good
man,<a id="footnotetagXXVIII5" name="footnotetagXXVIII5"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVIII5"><sup>5</sup></a> for whom I felt great affection, and I regret that he has
left Rome. You may be as good as he was, and we shall
become friends, but I do not know you yet, and Mr Lyons I
had known for many years; he is going to America, I hear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.311" id="pageiii.311"></a>[page&nbsp;311]</span>
and he will find the Americans far more difficult to deal with
than with us.</p>

<p class="ind">"I am much gratified to hear that the Prince of Wales is
likely to visit Rome, and Her Majesty, I feel sure, has done
well to allow him to prosecute his studies here. It will be an
honour to me to receive him at the Vatican, and I beg that
you will confer with Cardinal Antonelli<a id="footnotetagXXVIII6" name="footnotetagXXVIII6"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVIII6"><sup>6</sup></a> as to the best means
of making the Prince's visit here useful and pleasant. We
are anxious that all his wishes should be attended to, that he
may preserve a pleasant recollection of Rome in the future.
Alas! so many erroneous impressions exist about this country
that I hope you will not judge of us too rashly. We are
advised to make reforms, and it is not understood that those
very reforms, which would consist in giving this country a
Government of laymen, would make it cease to exist. It is
called 'States of the Church' (<i>&Eacute;tats de l' &Eacute;glise</i>), and that is
what it must remain. It is true I have lately appointed a
layman to a post formerly held by an ecclesiastic, and I may
do so again occasionally; but, however small we may be, we
cannot yield to outer pressure, and this country must be
administered by men of the Church. For my part, I shall
fulfil my duties according to my conscience, and should
Governments and events turn against me they cannot make
me yield. I shall go with the faithful to the Catacombs, as
did the Christians of the early centuries, and there await the
will of the Supreme Being, for I dread no human Power upon
earth and fear nothing but God."</p>

<p class="ind">"But, Holy Father," I said, "you speak as if some great
danger threatened Rome&mdash;is there any [real?] cause for
apprehension?"</p>

<p class="ind">"Have you not heard," His Holiness answered, "that
great excitement prevails throughout Italy?&mdash;the state of
Lombardy is deplorable; evil spirits are at work even in my
dominions, and the late speech of the King of Sardinia is
calculated to inflame the minds of all the revolutionary men
of Italy. It is true he says he will observe existing Treaties,
but that will scarcely counter-balance the effect produced by
other portions of his speech. News has also reached me of
an extensive amnesty granted by the King of Naples&mdash;he
did not yield to outer pressure, and he was right&mdash;but now,
on the occasion of the marriage of his son, an act of clemency
on his part is well advised."</p>

<p class="ind">"Is it true," I said, "that political prisoners are included
in that Amnesty?"</p>

<p class="ind">"Yes," His Holiness answered; "I saw the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.312" id="pageiii.312"></a>[page&nbsp;312]</span>
Settembrini, and I think also of that other man in whom your
Government took so much interest&mdash;his name begins with a
'P' if I remember rightly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="ind">"Poerio," I suggested.</p>

<p class="ind">"That is the name," the Pope continued; "and I fancy
that all the other political prisoners will be released; they are
to be sent to Cadiz at the expense of the King, they are to be
clothed and receive some money, I believe, and after that
arrangements have been made with the Minister of the United
States to have them conveyed to that country; they are to be
exiled for life. I hope this event may have the effect of making
your Government and that of France renew diplomatic relations
with Naples; I always regretted that rupture, but the
King was right not to yield to outer pressure.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE POPE AND LORD PALMERSTON</span>
<p class="ind">"It is lucky," the Pope ended with a smile, "that Lord
Palmerston is not in office; he was too fond of interfering in
the concerns of foreign countries, and the present crisis would
just have suited him. <i>Addio, caro</i>," the Pope then said, and
dismissed me with his blessing.</p>

<p class="ind">I then, according to usage, called on Cardinal Antonelli,
and recounted to him what had passed. He confirmed all
the Pope had said, but denied that there was any very serious
cause for immediate apprehension of any general disturbance
of the peace of Italy. I have, etc.,</p>

<p class="ind">The Earl of Malmesbury presents his humble duty to the
Queen, and has the honour to inform your Majesty that he has
seen the French Ambassador to-day, who came of his own
accord to say that we need be in no apprehension, of a war <i>at
present</i>, as the public opinion in France, especially in the large
towns, had been so strongly pronounced against a war that
it was impossible. Lord Malmesbury is also glad to inform
your Majesty that the Cabinet has agreed to-day to make
a great addition to the effective force of your Majesty's Navy.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty's commands are obeyed respecting the

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, 25th <i>January 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Earl of Malmesbury presents his humble duty to the
Queen, and regrets to say that he shares your Majesty's
apprehensions. The Emperor is extremely irritated at our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.313" id="pageiii.313"></a>[page&nbsp;313]</span>
not concurring in his views on Italy, and Lord Malmesbury
believes that nothing will restrain him but the public opinion
expressed against them, in France.<sup>7</sup> Austria has, against all
our advice and common prudence, made a false move by
sending troops into the Papal States <i>against</i> the wish of <i>the
Pope</i>, and is now obliged to recall them. The speech of your
Majesty is to be discussed in Cabinet to-day. Lord Derby
intended to introduce a paragraph stating that your Majesty's
Alliance with France remained "unimpaired," but it now
appears to us that such a statement might provoke a question
"<i>why</i>" it should be made a special one. Lord Malmesbury
entirely agrees with your Majesty as to an allusion to Treaties.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 7: Yet the Emperor had just written to Queen Victoria on 20th January: "Le corps
l&eacute;gislatif va bient&ocirc;t s'ouvrir, presque en m&ecirc;me temps que le parlement; je t&acirc;cherai
d'exprimer dans mon discours tout le d&eacute;sir que j'ai de vivre toujours en bonne et sinc&egrave;re
intelligence avec votre Majest&eacute; et son gouvernement." Early in February the pamphlet
<i>Napol&eacute;on et l'Italie</i>, nominally written by M. de la Gu&eacute;ronni&egrave;re, but inspired by the
Emperor, foreshadowed the war in Italy, and attempted to justify it.

<p class="ind">The Queen thinks that the time is come when the bestowal
of some honour or reward on Lord Canning ought no longer
to be delayed. He has now nearly arrived at the end of his
tremendous task of quelling the Rebellion, and has triumphed
over all his many difficulties. If any man deserves an acknowledgment
of his services at the hands of the Crown, it is
surely he, and the Queen would be sorry that the grace of it
should be taken away from her by questions being asked in
Parliament when it is assembled again, which will now be the
case very soon.</p>

<p class="ind">A step in the Peerage and the G.C.B. appear to the Queen
an appropriate reward. Perhaps a pension should be awarded
to him? Lord Elphinstone also ought not to be left unrewarded,
and a step in the Peerage with the G.C.B. does not
appear too high an honour for him, for he also has greatly contributed
to the saving to the Indian Empire.<sup>8</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 8: Lord Canning was made an Earl and Lord Elphinstone (who had been Governor of
Bombay during the Mutiny) a Peer of the United Kingdom, and both received the G.C.B.

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, and in obedience to your
Majesty's commands, received within this half hour through
Lord Malmesbury, submits the accompanying very hastily
drawn sketch of the language which, in his humble opinion,
your Majesty might hold in a private and confidential letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.315" id="pageiii.315"></a>[page&nbsp;315]</span>
to the Emperor of the French. Lord Derby is not sure that
it is what your Majesty desired that he should submit; but
he trusts that your Majesty will be pleased to receive it as an
attempt to obey your Majesty's commands, and will excuse
its many imperfections on account of the extreme haste in
which it has unavoidably been written.</p>

<p class="ind">"I cannot refrain from taking this opportunity of expressing
confidentially to your Imperial Majesty my deep anxiety for
the preservation of the peace of Europe, nor can I conceal from
myself how essentially that great object must depend upon
the course which your Imperial Majesty may be advised to
take. Your Majesty has now the opportunity, either by
listening to the dictates of humanity and justice, and by
demonstrating unmistakably your intention to adhere strictly
to the faithful observance of Treaties, of calming the apprehensions
of Europe, and restoring her confidence in your
Majesty's pacific policy; or, by permitting yourself to be
influenced by the ambitious or interested designs of others,
of involving Europe in a war, the extent and termination of
which can hardly be foreseen, and which, whatever glory it
may add to the arms of France, cannot but interfere materially
with her internal prosperity and financial credit. I am sure
that your Majesty will not doubt the sincerity of the friendship
which alone induces me to write thus unreservedly to your
Majesty, and if anything could add to the sorrow with which
I should view the renewal of war in Europe, it would be to see
your Majesty entering upon a course with which it would be
impossible for England to associate herself."<sup>10</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 10: The Queen accordingly wrote a letter, which is printed in the <i>Life of the Prince

now his for exercising a personal influence for the peace of Europe, and that, by faithful
observance of Treaty obligations, he might calm international anxieties.

<span class="rightnote">THE INDIAN ARMY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>. <i>5th February 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to a decision which will have to be taken when
the report of the Indian Army Commission shall have been
received, the Queen thinks it incumbent upon her not to leave
Lord Derby in ignorance of her firm determination not to
sanction, under any form, the creation of a British Army,
distinct from that known at present as the Army of the Crown.</p>

<p class="ind">She would consider it dangerous to the maintenance of India,
to the dependence of the Indian Empire on the mother country,
and to her Throne in these realms.</p>

<p class="ind">Such an Army would be freed from the proper control of
the constitutional monarchy. It would be removed from the
direct command of the Crown, and entirely independent of
Parliament. It would throw an unconstitutional amount of
power and patronage into the hands of the Indian Council and
Government; it would be raised and maintained in antagonism
to the Regular Army of the Crown; and professional jealousy,
and personal and private interests, would needs drive it into a
position of permanent hostility towards that Army.</p>

<p class="ind">This hostility has been already strongly marked in the proceedings
of the Commission itself.</p>

<p class="ind">Its detrimental effects would not be confined to India alone,
but would form a most dangerous obstacle to the maintenance
of the government of the Regular Army by the Queen.
Already, during the Crimean War, most of the blows levelled
at the Army and the prerogative of the Crown were directed
by Indian officers, of whom, in future, a vast number would be
at home, without employment or recognised position, in compact
organisation, and moved by a unity of feeling.</p>

<p class="ind">There may be points of detail, admitting differences of
opinion as to the relative advantages of a purely local or general
Military Force for India; but these are mere trifles, which
sink into insignificance in the Queen's estimation, when she has
to consider the duty which she owes to her Crown and her
Country.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN AND LORD STANLEY</span>
<p class="ind">The Queen hopes Lord Derby will not consider that she
intends, by this letter, unduly to influence his free consideration
and decision as to the advice he may think it his duty to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.317" id="pageiii.317"></a>[page&nbsp;317]</span>
offer, but merely to guard against his being taken by surprise,
and to prevent, if possible, an unseemly public difference
between herself and Lord Stanley. She is impelled to the
apprehension that such may arise from the manner in which,
since the first transfer of the Indian Government to the
Crown, every act of Lord Stanley has uniformly tended to
place the Queen in a position which would render her helpless
and powerless in resisting a scheme which certain persons,
imbued with the old Indian traditions, would appear to wish
to force upon the Crown.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen does not expect an answer to this letter from
Lord Derby, and asks him to treat it as strictly confidential.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sees that Lord Stanley means to make a statement
on Monday on the Indian Finances. She trusts that there
will be nothing said in that statement to prejudge the Army

produced an excellent effect, as also the Debates in Parliament.<sup>11</sup>
The Emperor has expressed himself ready to subscribe to every
word of Lord Derby's speech.</p>


<p class="note1">Footnote 11: Parliament was opened by the Queen in person on the 3rd; the ensuing debates,
and especially the speeches of the Liberal leaders, showed that, however much the
English nation, as a whole, might sympathise with Italian aspirations for the expulsion
of the Austrians from Lombardy, they would regard unfavourably a war commenced
in defiance of Treaty obligations.

<span class="rightnote">THE INDIAN ARMY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">St James's Square</span>, <i>6th February 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty
his respectful acknowledgment of the explicitness with which
the letter he had the honour of receiving last night conveys to
him the intimation of your Majesty's views upon the important
subject of the Indian Army. He cannot, however, disguise
from your Majesty the deep pain which that communication
has occasioned him; first, that your Majesty should think
that Lord Stanley has so far mistaken his duty as systematically
to place your Majesty in a false position; and next because
unless Lord Derby misconceives the purport of your Majesty's
letter, he fears that it may leave him no alternative but that of
humbly entreating to be relieved from a responsibility which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.318" id="pageiii.318"></a>[page&nbsp;318]</span>
nothing should have induced him to undertake but a sense of
duty to your Majesty, and the conviction that he might rely
with confidence upon your Majesty's continued support. It
would ill become Lord Derby to attempt to argue a question
on which your Majesty has expressed so strong a determination;
he has studiously avoided taking any step which might
prejudge a question so important as the organisation of your
Majesty's Forces in India. He has awaited the report of the
Commission appointed to enquire into the subject, and though
aware of the wide difference of opinion which prevailed, has
desired impartially to weigh and examine the arguments
adduced on both sides, and he has in the meantime refused
to give his sanction to a proposition, earnestly pressed
upon the Government by Lord Canning, for immediately
raising additional regiments for Indian Service. But the
announcement of your Majesty's determination (if he rightly
understands it), under no circumstances to continue an
European Army in India, under terms of service different from
those of the Line, paid out of Indian Revenues, and officered by
men educated for that especial service, and looking to India
for their whole career, places Lord Derby in a position of
no little embarrassment; for notwithstanding the gracious
intimation that your Majesty does not desire unduly to influence
his judgment as to the advice which he may tender, it
amounts to a distinct warning that if tendered in a particular
direction it has no chance of being accepted by your Majesty.
Nor, with that knowledge on his part not shared by his colleagues,
can he freely discuss with them the course which they
may consider it their duty to pursue.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby humbly trusts, therefore, that your Majesty
will be graciously pleased, so far as the members of the Government
are concerned, to absolve him from the obligation of
secrecy, and to allow him to place before them a state of things
which may lead to the most serious results, so far as their
power of serving your Majesty is concerned.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby will give Lord Stanley a caution not to say
anything in his statement of Indian Finance which may prejudge
the question of a single or separate armies; but he hardly
thinks the caution necessary, as European troops, whether in
one Service or in two, will equally be chargeable to the revenues
of India, which will only be affected by the proportion which
the whole of the European may bear to the whole of the
native forces.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.319" id="pageiii.319"></a>[page&nbsp;319]</span>
satisfactory effects produced by your Majesty's private letter
to the Emperor.</p>

<p class="ind">The above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most
dutiful Servant and Subject,</p>

<span class="rightnote">INDIVISIBILITY OF ARMY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>7th February 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is very sorry to learn from Lord Derby's letter,
received last evening, that her communication to him on the
Indian Army question had caused him deep pain. She had
long hesitated whether she should write it, from a fear that its
purport and motive might possibly be misunderstood; but
feeling that there ought to exist nothing but the most unreserved
and entire confidence between herself and her Prime
Minister, she thought it incumbent upon her to let Lord Derby
see exactly what was passing in her mind.</p>

<p class="ind">If, notwithstanding the Queen's expressed hope that Lord
Derby might not consider the communication as intended unduly
to influence his free consideration of the important subject,
he should feel that its possession, without being at liberty to
communicate it to his colleagues, does so in effect, she would
ask him to return it to her, and to consider it as not having
been written. If he should think, however, that a communication
of the Queen's views to the Cabinet is due to them,
she is quite prepared to make one. In that case it would
naturally have to be differently worded, would omit every
reference to Lord Stanley, and might go more into detail.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen cannot close this letter without correcting some
misapprehensions into which Lord Derby seems to have fallen.
It was not the Queen's intention to impute any motives of
systematic action to Lord Stanley; she referred simply to
facts and steps, known as well to Lord Derby as to herself,
which "uniformly tended" to place her in a powerless position
with regard to the Army question.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen protested against "the <i>creation</i> of a British
Army distinct (in its existence and constitutional position)
from that of the Crown," and not against the "<i>continuance</i>
of an European Army, under terms of service different from
the Line, paid out of Indian Revenues, and officered by men
educated for that special service, and looking to India for their
whole career." In fact, she does not understand what meaning
Lord Derby attaches to the words "terms of service." Every
force kept in India, however constituted, would be paid out of
Indian Revenues. <i>This</i> would therefore not form the distinction,
and Lord Derby cannot intend to convey that on
these revenues one set of Englishmen can have a greater claim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.320" id="pageiii.320"></a>[page&nbsp;320]</span>
than another; nor does she see why English officers, commanding
English soldiers and charged with the maintenance
of <i>their</i> discipline and efficiency, should for that object require
to be specially and differently educated, and be restricted to
look to India for their whole career. Officers attached to
native troops are in a different position.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty
his grateful acknowledgments for your Majesty's most gracious
note received this evening, the contents, and still more the
tenor of which have relieved him from the painful apprehension
that he might be called upon to choose between a
strong sense of public duty, and, on the other side, his deep
devotion to your Majesty's service, and his gratitude for the
favourable consideration which his imperfect attempts to
discharge his public duty had always received at your Majesty's
hand. The explanation, with which he has now been honoured,
of your Majesty's views has entirely dispelled those
apprehensions, and he feels that he has only to thank your
Majesty for the gracious explanation, with which he has
been honoured, of your Majesty's motives in addressing to
him the letter which certainly caused him "deep pain."...<sup>12</sup></p>

Derby. The Queen will, in compliance with his request,
defer any further notice of the subject until the Commissioners
shall have made their report; it would not be fair, however,
to Lord Derby, not to add that she fears from his explanation
that he has not now correctly estimated the nature of the
Queen's objection, which is not to a variety of forces, terms
of service, local or general employment, etc., etc., etc., established
in one Army, but to the principle of <i>two</i> British

<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>21st February 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, and in obedience to
the commands which he had the honour of receiving from
your Majesty last night, submits the following suggestions,
as embodying the substance of what, in his humble judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.322" id="pageiii.322"></a>[page&nbsp;322]</span>
your Majesty might address with advantage in a private
letter to the Emperor of Austria.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty might say, that deeply penetrated with the
conviction of the duty imposed upon your Majesty of acting
on the principles enunciated in the speech from the Throne,
of exercising whatever influence your Majesty could employ
for the preservation of the general peace, your Majesty had
looked with anxiety to the circumstances which threatened its
continued existence. That your Majesty was unable to see
in those circumstances, any which were beyond the reach
of diplomatic skill, if there were only a mutual desire, on
the part of the Chief Powers concerned, to give fair play
to its exercise. That the only source of substantial danger
was the present state of Italy; and that even in that
there would be little danger of interruption to the general
tranquillity, were it not for the antagonism excited by interests
and engagements, real or supposed, of France and
Austria.</p>

<p class="ind">That your Majesty believed that the supposed divergence
of these interests and engagements might be capable of reconciliation
if entered into with mutual frankness, and with a
mutual disposition to avoid the calamities of war; but that,
as it appeared to your Majesty, neither party would be willing
to invite the other to a friendly discussion of the points of
difference between them.</p>

<p class="ind">That in this state of affairs your Majesty, as a mutual friend
of both Sovereigns, and having no individual interests to
serve, entertained the hope that by the spontaneous offer
of good offices, your Majesty might be the means of establishing
certain bases, on which the Powers mainly interested
might subsequently enter into amicable negotiations with
regard to the questions chiefly in dispute, or threatening
serious results.</p>

<p class="ind">Of these, the most pressing are those which relate to the
Italian Peninsula.</p>

<p class="ind">That your Majesty, anxiously revolving in your mind
the question how your Majesty's influence could best be
brought to bear, had come to the conclusion that your
Majesty's Ambassador at Paris, having the fullest knowledge
of the views entertained by that Court, and possessing
your Majesty's entire confidence, might usefully be
intrusted with a highly confidential, but wholly unofficial
mission, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there were
any possibility consistently with the views of the two Courts
of offering such suggestions as might be mutually acceptable
as the basis of future arrangements; and, if such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.323" id="pageiii.323"></a>[page&nbsp;323]</span>
should happily be found to be the case, of offering them
simultaneously to the two parties, as the suggestions of a
mutual friend.</p>

<p class="ind">That your Majesty trusted His R.I.A.<sup>15</sup> Majesty would
look upon this communication in the truly friendly light
in which it was intended, and that Lord Cowley, in his unofficial
and confidential character, might be permitted fully
to develop the views which your Majesty entertained, and
to meet with the most favourable consideration of his suggestions
from His R.I.A. Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, before submitting the above to your Majesty,
has thought it right to communicate it to Lord Malmesbury
and Lord Cowley, and he is enabled to say that it meets with
their entire concurrence.<sup>16</sup> He will be highly gratified if he
is permitted to know that it is honoured by your Majesty's
gracious approval. All which is humbly submitted by your
Majesty's most dutiful Servant and Subject,</p>

<p class="ind">It is generally rumoured that, on Friday next, Lord Palmerston
is to move a vote of censure upon your Majesty's Government

suppose that the formal censure will take the shape of a rattling

procured the rejection of the proposed measure, and a solution was not arrived

good.<sup>20</sup></p>

as about this! And then it is an <i>occasion</i> so gratifying to
both <i>Nations</i>, which brings them <i>so much</i> together, that it
is <i>most</i> peculiarly mortifying! It is a <i>stupid law</i> in Prussia,
I must say, to be so particular about having the child christened

<span class="rightnote">A PROPOSED CONFERENCE</span>

<p class="indright"><i>20th March 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Malmesbury's letter<sup>21</sup> written
before the Cabinet yesterday. The Memorandum of Lord
Cowley and the telegrams from Vienna give better hopes of
the idea of Congress or Conference leading to a good result.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.326" id="pageiii.326"></a>[page&nbsp;326]</span>
Everything will now depend upon the Emperor Napoleon's
acceptance of the conditions on which Austria is willing to
agree to a Conference. The Queen would like to have a
copy of Lord Cowley's memorandum.<sup>22</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 21: Lord Cowley had returned from his mission to Vienna, and was now again at Paris.
The complexion of affairs had been changed by a suggestion on the part of Russia (which
may or may not have been ultimately prompted from Paris) for a Conference between
England, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia, to settle the Italian Question. Cavour
pressed for the admission of Piedmont to the Conference.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 22: Lord Malmesbury's letter to Lord Cowley, written immediately after the Cabinet,
enjoined him to impress upon the Emperor that England would only address herself to
the four points&mdash;evacuation of the Roman States by foreign troops, reform, security for
Sardinia, and a substitute for the treaties of 1847 between Austria and the Duchies.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>22nd March 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thanks Lord Malmesbury for his communication
of yesterday, which she received this morning. She
quite approves the steps taken by the Government,<sup>23</sup> and
concurs in Lord Malmesbury's views. If the understanding
about a Conference first of the five Powers, and then of the
Italian States with them, <i>could be</i> so far come to that France
and Austria agree with us upon the conditions on which it is
to take place, we need not wait for Russia's proposing it.
She is evidently playing, as she always does, a double game,
and from Sir John Crampton's<sup>24</sup> letter it appears that she
never meant to propose a Congress, but merely to <i>accept</i> one,
for ulterior objects.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 23: An attempt to obtain the disarmament of Austria and Sardinia, and a proposal to
obtain the co-operation of France, in guaranteeing to defend Sardinia against invasion by
Austria for five years, unless Sardinia left her own territory. On the 23rd, Lord Malmesbury
wrote that all the great Powers, except Austria, had agreed to a Congress upon the
conditions laid down by the British Government.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 24: English Ambassador at St Petersburg, formerly Minister at Washington; see <i>ante</i>,
<a href="#pageiii.219" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 219</a>. He had succeeded to the baronetcy in 1858.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>27th March 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen trusts that Lord Malmesbury will act with
the utmost circumspection in answering the many telegrams
crossing each other from all directions respecting the proposed
Congress. An understanding with Austria on every
point ought, if possible, to precede our giving our opinion
to France or Russia. If they can <i>once</i> get the Powers to
agree upon a point upon which Austria disagrees, they have
won the game, and the Emperor can proceed to his war,
having a declaration of Europe against Austria as his basis.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>12th April 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has marked a passage in this draft, which she
thinks it would be advisable to modify&mdash;so as not to <i>put</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.327" id="pageiii.327"></a>[page&nbsp;327]</span>
upon <i>record</i> (should the Austrians refuse to give way on this
point) that we consider their conduct as "<i>reckless</i>." Should
they persist, they would certainly not meet with as much
sympathy as they would do if they yielded, and such a course
on their part would be very much to be regretted, as we
consider every sacrifice small, in comparison to the blessings
of preserving peace; but still Austria would have a perfect
right to stand out&mdash;and we originally supported her in this
demand.</p>

<p class="ind">If something which <i>expressed</i> the <i>above</i> sentiments and
opinions could therefore be substituted for the present passage,
the Queen thinks it would be very desirable <i>for the
future</i>, both as regards Austria and England.</p>

may be the results to herself, she deprives herself of all claim
to the support or countenance of England.<sup>25</sup> Your Majesty
will see by another telegram, received a few minutes ago
from Lord Cowley, that H&uuml;bner!! advises that England
should threaten to come to the aid of Sardinia, if the contemplated
invasion should take place! Your Majesty's
servants are not, however, prepared to take so strong a step,
which would commit them to measures to which they might
be unable at the moment to give due effect; and which, if
Austria were to disregard the measure, would involve them in
War as the Allies of France. They have therefore limited
themselves to a protest, the terms of which will require to be
very carefully considered before it is embodied in a despatch.
Lord Malmesbury will submit to your Majesty by this messenger
the terms of his telegram.... To appeal at once to
arms, when no question, except this of form, remained unsettled
as to the meeting of Congress, and the subjects to be
then discussed, had been unanimously agreed to, appears to
Lord Derby to indicate a reckless determination to go to war
which it will be very difficult to justify in the eyes of Europe.</p>

<p class="ind"> ... Lord Derby has thought it necessary, in consequence
of the attitude assumed by Russia, notwithstanding her
assurances that there is nothing hostile to England in her
secret treaty with France, to call upon Sir J. Pakington to
say what addition could be made to the Channel Fleet within
a period of two or three months, without weakening that in
the Mediterranean. He has the honour of enclosing the
answer, which he has just received by messenger. Lord Derby
proposes to go up to Town to confer with Sir J. Pakington
on this important subject to-morrow, and Lord Malmesbury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.329" id="pageiii.329"></a>[page&nbsp;329]</span>
has summoned a Cabinet for Friday to consider the general
state of affairs.</p>

<p class="ind">France having absolutely refused the proffered mediation
of England, and Austria having only accepted it under the
condition of the disarmament of Sardinia, every effort to
preserve the peace has been exhausted; and it only remains
for this country to watch the course of events, to protect her
own interests, and to look out for any opportunity which may
offer to mediate between the contending parties. This policy,
announced by Lord Derby in the City on Monday,<sup>27</sup> was received
with unanimous approval. It will require a great
deal to induce the country to be drawn into a war under any
circumstances, and Lord Derby's anxious efforts will not be
wanting to avoid it as long as possible.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 27: He had there described Austria's action as hasty, precipitate, and (because involving
warfare) criminal, but the Government would still (he added) strive to avert war, by
urging Austria, under the Treaty of Paris, to invoke the mediation of the Powers. The
Derby Government, however, were supposed to be giving encouragement to Austria.

<p class="ind">The Queen has read the last telegrams with much pain,
as they show that there is no chance left of stopping war.
Indeed she thinks, considering the progress of revolution in
the Duchies, and the daily increase of military strength of
France and financial exhaustion of Austria, that it would
not be morally defensible to try to restrain Austria from
defending herself while she still can.</p>

<p class="ind">Count Buol's proposal to continue negotiations during the
fight sounds strange, but ought not to be altogether put
aside. The King of Sardinia's assumption of the Government
of Tuscany<sup>28</sup> and military occupation of Massa-Carrara
form gross infractions of the Treaties of 1815 and international
law, and can hardly be left without a protest from us.</p>

<p class="ind">Has Lord Derby heard that a Russian Fleet is expected
soon to appear in the Black Sea? The Queen has just heard
it from Berlin, where it is supposed to be certain, and it
would explain Lord Cowley's report of (the Queen believes)
Prince Napoleon's<sup>29</sup> account of the Russian engagements,
which are admitted to contemplate a junction of the French
and Russian Fleets to defend the Treaty closing the Dardanelles.</p>

<p class="ind"> ... Lord Derby entirely concurs in your Majesty's opinion
that no credit is to be attached to the denials of the French
or Russian Governments in regard to the engagements subsisting
between them.<sup>30</sup> It is very easy to convey denials
in terms which are literally true, but practically and in spirit
false; and Lord Derby has no doubt but that France is well
assured that in any case she may rely upon the tacit assistance,
if not the active co-operation, of Russia; and that
both Powers are using their utmost endeavours to excite
troubles in the East, as well as in Italy, as the result of which
France may gratify her cherished designs of ambition in the
latter, while Russia carries on her projects of aggrandisement
in the former. This is a lamentable state of affairs; but it
is Lord Derby's duty to assure your Majesty that no Government
which could be formed in this country could hope to
carry public opinion with it in taking an active part, as matters
now stand, in opposition to France and Russia, if in truth
they are acting in concert, as Lord Derby believes that they
are. All that can be done is to maintain the principle of strict
neutrality in regard to the affairs of Italy, and probably of
Montenegro also, though there is not sufficient evidence of
facts in that case to justify a positive conclusion. But in
the meantime everything shows more conclusively the absolute
necessity for the increase of your Majesty's Naval
Force,<sup>31</sup> which was determined at the Council yesterday, and
respecting which it will be necessary, on the very first day
of the meeting of the new Parliament, to call for an explicit
expression of opinion.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty enquires as to a supposed pledge given by
the Emperor of the French as to a denial of any Treaty with
Sardinia. So far as Lord Derby can recollect at this moment,
there never was more than an assurance that so long as Austria
remained within her own limits, he would not interfere; and
that he would not support Sardinia, unless she were herself
invaded in any <i>unjustifiable</i> attack on Austria; and there
was also a denial in the <i>Moniteur</i>, to which your Majesty
probably refers, of there having been any engagement entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.331" id="pageiii.331"></a>[page&nbsp;331]</span>
into <i>as a condition of the marriage</i>.<sup>32</sup> These are just the denials
to which Lord Derby has already adverted, which appear
at first sight satisfactory, but which may be afterwards explained
away, so as to escape the charge of absolute falsehood.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby trusts that your Majesty will have understood,
and excused, his absence from the Council on Saturday, in
consequence of the misunderstanding as to the time appointed.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 30: Lord Cowley, in a letter of the 29th of April to Lord Malmesbury, described an
interview with the Emperor of the French, when the latter denied in terms the existence
of a signed Treaty between France and Russia. But, as Lord Cowley added, there might
be moral engagements which might easily lead to a more specific alliance.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 31: The Emperor had interrogated Lord Cowley as to this.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 32: In July 1858, the joint action of France and Sardinia had been concerted at the
confidential interview at Plombi&egrave;res, between the Emperor and Cavour, the former
undertaking to assist Sardinia, under certain contingencies, against Austria. On the
same occasion the marriage was suggested of the Princess Clothilde of Sardinia to the
Prince Napoleon Joseph Paul, son of Prince Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte. An interesting
account of the events of this time, and of the character and aims of Cavour, will be found
in De la Gorce's <i>Histoire du Second Empire</i>; see especially vol. ii. book 14.

Sardinia are spoken of as the offenders, and blamed, not
without sufficient ground, for the parts which they have

<span class="rightnote">POLICY OF THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON</span>

<p class="indright"><i>15th May 1859.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Earl of Malmesbury presents his humble duty to the
Queen, and has the honour to inform your Majesty that Count
de Persigny<sup>36</sup> called on him yesterday. He passed an hour
in attempting to prove what it seems he really believes himself&mdash;that
the Emperor had no plan or even intention to
make war in Italy; that His Imperial Majesty was drawn into
it step by step by M. de Cavour, who finally menaced to publish
his most confidential correspondence, etc.; that his army
was totally unprepared, and is now in a very imperfect state,
and that he himself was overcome with surprise and fear
when he learnt in the middle of last month that the Austrians
had 120,000 men on the Ticino.<sup>37</sup> The Emperor, however,
now believes that he will easily gain a <i>couple</i> of victories, and
that when he has <i>rejet&eacute; les Autrichiens dans leur tani&egrave;re</i> (by
which he means their great fortresses), he will return to govern
at Paris, and leave a Marshal to carry on the sieges and the
war. M. de Persigny's letters of appointment are not yet
signed, and must go to Italy to be so. He stated that a week
ago he was named Minister of Foreign Affairs, and that Fould,<sup>38</sup>
Walewski, and others were to be dismissed, but that two days
before the Emperor's departure Madame Walewska<sup>39</sup> and the
Empress had on their knees obtained a reprieve, and that
M. de Persigny was ordered to come here <i>sans raisonner</i>...</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 36: Who had been re-appointed to London, where Marshal P&eacute;lissier, Duc de Malakhoff,
had replaced him in 1858. See <i>ante</i>, <a href="#pageiii.276" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 276</a>. Both Malakhoff and Walewski were out of
sympathy with the Emperor's present policy.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 37: Sir James Hudson, in a letter written at Turin on the 28th of February, and shown
to Queen Victoria, described an interview with Cavour, who, in answer to the direct
question, "Do you mean to attack Austria?" replied that the Italian question was becoming
so complex that it was impossible to say what might happen. Sir J. Hudson
added that he had learned confidentially that the understanding on the same subject between
Cavour and the Emperor Napoleon was complete, and that it had been expressed
thus: "Non seulement nous prendrons la premi&egrave;re occasion de faire la guerre &agrave; l'Autriche,
mais nous chercherons un pr&eacute;texte."</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 38: Achille Fould, a Jewish banker, was a colleague of Walewski, though not a loyal one,
in the French Government.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen was much surprised to receive the enclosed
telegram. An alliance with Russia to <i>localise</i> and <i>arrest</i> the
war by joint interference, which is here proposed to Russia,
is a policy to which the Queen has not given her sanction,
and which would require very mature deliberation before it
could ever be entertained. The Queen is much afraid of these
telegraphic short messages on principles of policy, and would
beg Lord Malmesbury to be most cautious as they may lead
us into difficulties without the possibility of previous consideration.
How can we propose to join Russia, whom
we know to be pledged to France? The Queen hopes Lord
Malmesbury will stop the communication of this message, to
Prince Gortschakoff.<sup>40</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 40: A telegram had been received from St Petersburg, saying that Prince Gortschakoff
entirely coincided with Lord Malmesbury's views as to localising the war; and Lord
Malmesbury had proposed to send a telegraphic reply containing the words: "We are
anxious to unite with Russia, not only in localising the war, but in arresting it."

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>22nd May 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">In answer to Lord Derby's letter of yesterday referring to
the importance of concerting with Russia the best modes of
preventing the extension of the war, the Queen wishes merely
to observe: That Russia has acknowledged her desire to see
the Austrians defeated, and her indifference to the maintenance
of the Treaties of 1815; France wages war to drive the
Austrians out of Italy, wresting from them the Italian provinces
secured to them by those treaties; and that the Queen
has declared from the Throne her adhesion to these treaties
to which Parliament unanimously responded. France and
Russia may therefore have an interest, and indeed <i>must</i> have
one, in not being disturbed in any way in the prosecution of
their Italian scheme. England can have no such interest.
If France prove successful, the territorial arrangements of
Europe, in which England has found safety, and which she
helped to establish in order to obtain safety against France
after a war of twenty years' duration, will be subverted, and
she herself may some day (perhaps <i>soon</i>) have her own safety
imperilled. The Saxon provinces of Prussia will be in much
greater danger when France shall have destroyed Austria in
Italy and ruined her at home, than while the latter remains a
powerful member of the German Confederation. What the
Queen is naturally anxious to guard against is our being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.335" id="pageiii.335"></a>[page&nbsp;335]</span>
drawn by degrees into playing the game of those who have
produced the present disturbance, and whose ulterior views
are very naturally and very wisely by them concealed from us.
The Queen is glad to hear that the telegram in question was
not sent, having been alarmed by its being marked as having
been despatched "at noon" on the 20th. The Queen wishes
Lord Derby to show this letter to Lord Malmesbury.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.336" id="pageiii.336"></a>[page&nbsp;336]</span>

part of maintaining a neutrality&mdash;<i>&agrave; tout prix</i>&mdash;whatever
circumstances may arise, which would do harm abroad, and
be inconvenient at home.<sup>42</sup> What the Queen may express is
her wish to remain neutral, and her hope that circumstances
will allow her to do so. The paragraph about the Navy<sup>43</sup> as
it stands makes our position still more humble, as it contains
a public apology for arming, and yet betrays fear of our being
attacked by France.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE QUESTION OF NEUTRALITY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>2nd June 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty
that he has most anxiously, and with every desire to meet
your Majesty's wishes, reflected upon the effect of the alterations
suggested by your Majesty in the proposed Speech from
the Throne. He has considered the consequences involved
so serious that he has thought it right to confer upon the
subject with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Leader of
the House of Commons; and it is a duty which he owes to
your Majesty not to withhold the expression of their clear
and unhesitating conviction. Lord Derby trusts that your
Majesty will forgive the frankness with which, in the accompanying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.337" id="pageiii.337"></a>[page&nbsp;337]</span>
observations, he feels it necessary to submit to your
Majesty the grounds for the view which they are compelled
to take.</p>

<p class="ind">The first paragraph to which your Majesty takes exception
is that which intimates your Majesty's "intention" to maintain
a strict and impartial neutrality, and "hope" to be
enabled to preserve peace. Your Majesty apprehends that
this may be interpreted into a determination to preserve
neutrality <i>&agrave; tout prix</i>; but Lord Derby would venture to
observe that such an inference is negatived by the subsequent
words, which only imply a "hope" of preserving peace.
With the cessation of that hope, neutrality would necessarily
terminate. But as matters stand at present, Lord Derby
is warranted in assuring your Majesty that if there is one subject
on which more than another the mind of the country is
unanimous, it is that of an entire abstinence from participation
in the struggle now going on in Italy. He collects this from
the language of politicians of almost every class, from all the
public papers, from Addresses and Memorials which he receives
every day&mdash;some urging, and some congratulating him upon
the adoption of a perfectly neutral policy. The sympathies
of the country are neither with France nor with Austria, but
were it not for the intervention of France, they would be
general in favour of Italy. The charge now made against
your Majesty's servants, by the opposition Press, as the
<i>Morning Post</i> and <i>Daily News</i>, is that their neutrality covers
such wishes and designs in favour of Austria; and any word
in your Majesty's Speech which should imply a doubt of
the continuance of strict impartiality, would, undoubtedly,
provoke a hostile Amendment, which might very possibly
be carried in the Sardinian sense, and which, if so carried,
would place your Majesty in the painful position of having
to select an Administration, pledged against the interests of
Austria and of Germany. Lord Derby says nothing of the
personal results to your Majesty's present servants, because,
in such cases, personal considerations ought not to be allowed
to prevail; and it is in the interest of the country only, and
even of the very cause which your Majesty desires to uphold,
that he earnestly trusts that your Majesty will not require
any alteration in this part of the Speech. There is, at this
moment, in the country, a great jealousy and suspicion of
France, and of her ulterior designs&mdash;as indicated by the
demand of means of defence, the formation of Volunteer Corps,
etc.&mdash;but it is neutralised, partly by sympathy for Italy,
partly by suspicions, industriously circulated, of the pro-Austrian
tendencies of the present Government. It is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.338" id="pageiii.338"></a>[page&nbsp;338]</span>
important that the language of the Speech should be so decided
as to negative this impression, and Lord Derby cannot but
feel that if neutrality be spoken of not as a thing decided
upon, but which, it is hoped, may be maintained, such language
will be taken to intimate the expectation of the Government
that it may, at no distant time, be departed from. In
Lord Derby's humble opinion Peace should be spoken of as
subject to doubt, because, out of the present struggle, complications
may arise which may necessarily involve us in war;
but neutrality, as between the present belligerents, should be
a matter open to no doubt or question. If there be no attempt
made to run counter to public opinion, and Austria should
sustain serious reverses, the jealousy of France will increase,
and the feeling of the country will support your Majesty in a
war, should such arise, against her aggression; but if the
slightest pretext be afforded for doubting the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
character of British neutrality, or the firm determination to
maintain it, an anti-German feeling will be excited, which will
be fatal to the Administration, and seriously embarrassing
to your Majesty.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE NAVY</span>
<p class="ind">The same observations apply, with hardly less force, to part
of the Amendment suggested by your Majesty to the paragraph
regarding the Navy. With submission to your Majesty,
Lord Derby can hardly look upon it as humiliating to a great
country, in announcing a large increase of its Naval Force,
to disclaim any object of aggression. These words, however,
might, if your Majesty were so pleased, be omitted, though
Lord Derby cannot go so far as to say that in his humble
judgment the omission would be an improvement; but he
trusts that your Majesty will be satisfied with a general
reference to the "state of Europe" without speaking of the
"complications which a war carried on by some of the Great<span class="rightnote">LORD DERBY'S CRITICISMS</span>
Powers may produce." These words would infallibly lead
to a demand for explanation, and for a statement of the
nature of the "complications" which the Government foresaw
as likely to lead to war. In humbly tendering to your Majesty
his most earnest advice that your Majesty will not insist on
the proposed Amendments in his Draft Speech, he believes
that he may assure your Majesty that he is expressing the
unanimous opinion of his Colleagues. Of their sentiments
your Majesty may judge by the fact that in the original draft
he had spoken of your Majesty's "intention" to preserve
peace "as long as it might be possible"; but by universal
concurrence these latter words were struck out, and the
"hope" was, instead of them, substituted for the "intention."
Should your Majesty, however, be pleased so to order, Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.339" id="pageiii.339"></a>[page&nbsp;339]</span>
Derby will immediately submit the question to the consideration
of his Colleagues, in order that your Majesty may be put,
in the most authentic form, in possession of their views. He
assures your Majesty that nothing can be more repugnant to
his feelings than to appear to offer objections to any suggestions
emanating from your Majesty; and he has only been
induced to do so upon the present occasion by the deep conviction
which he entertains of the danger attending the course
proposed, and the serious embarrassments which it would
cause your Majesty. He regrets more especially having been
compelled to take this step at a moment when your Majesty's
thoughts are very differently engaged, and when it may be
doubly irksome to have matters of public business pressed
upon your Majesty's consideration.</p>

<p class="ind">The above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most
dutiful Servant and Subject,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Derby</span>.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>3rd June 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Derby's answer to her observations
on the proposed Speech. There is in fact no difference
of opinion between her and Lord Derby; the latter only
keeps in view the effect which certain words will have in
Parliament and upon the country, whilst she looks to the
effect they will produce upon the European conflict. If the
Queen were not obliged to speak, both positions might be
well reconciled; but if what she is going to declare from the
Throne is to allay suspicions purposely raised by the Opposition
against the Government that they intended to take
part at some moment or other in the war, and is to give absolute
security to the country against this contingency, this
will be the very thing France would wish to bring about in
order to ensure to her the fullest liberty in prosecuting her
schemes for disturbing and altering the territorial state of
Europe. How is this impression to be avoided? Lord
Derby thinks that the expression of "hope" to be able to
preserve peace to this country is a sufficient indication that
this country reserves to herself still a certain liberty of action;
but the Queen would have interpreted it rather as the expression
of a hope, that we may not be attacked, particularly when
followed by the sentence in which all intention of aggression
is disclaimed, and that our armaments are merely meant for
defence. The sense would then appear as this: "As the
belligerents separately assure me of their friendship, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.340" id="pageiii.340"></a>[page&nbsp;340]</span>
determined to maintain a strict neutrality between them, and
hope they may not change their minds, and attack me; I
arm, but merely to defend myself if attacked." This would
abdicate on the part of this country her position as one of
the arbiters of Europe, declare her indifference to treaties or
the balance of power (which are, in fact, of the greatest value
to her), and would preclude her from any action to preserve
them. The Queen fully enters into the Parliamentary difficulty,
and would deprecate nothing more than to expose the
Government to a defeat on an Amendment which would lead
to the formation of a new Government on the principle of
neutrality <i>&agrave; tout prix</i> imposed by Parliament on the Crown.</p>

<p class="ind">It will be for Lord Derby and his colleagues to consider how
far they may be able to avoid this danger without exposing
themselves to that pointed out by the Queen. She puts herself
entirely in his hands, and had suggested the verbal amendments
merely with a view to indicate the nature of the difficulty
which had struck her. Whatever decision Lord Derby
may on further reflection come to, the Queen is prepared to
accept.<sup>44</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 44: Ultimately the Cabinet recommended the modification of the declaration of neutrality
by the insertion of the words "between them"; so as to run: "I intend to maintain
<i>between them</i> a strict and impartial neutrality," etc.; and in the second paragraph proposed
to omit the words "with no object of aggression, but"&mdash;and adopting the form
of the Queen's paragraph, but omitting the words referring to possible complications, to
leave it thus: "Considering, however, the present state of Europe, I have deemed it
necessary for the security of my Dominions," etc.

Nothing could be more dangerous and unwise than at this

<p class="note1">Footnote 46: He flung his taunts right and left at the now united Opposition, and was especially
bitter against Sir James Graham. Referring to the Liberal meeting on the 6th, Mr
Disraeli reminded the House that Willis's Rooms had, as Almack's, formerly been maintained
by fashionable patronesses. "The distinguished assemblies that met within
those walls were controlled by a due admixture of dowagers and youthful beauties&mdash;young
reputations and worn celebrities&mdash;and it was the object of all social ambition to
enter there. Now Willis's Rooms are under the direction of patrons, and there are two
of these patrons below the gangway" (indicating Lord John Russell and Mr Sidney
Herbert). In regard to its Foreign Policy, he said the Government should not be condemned
without direct documentary evidence. Lord Malmesbury has since deplored
Mr Disraeli's neglect to produce the Blue Book with the correspondence relating to the
affairs of Italy and Austria, and stated that, had he laid it on the table, the debate would
have ended differently (<i>Memoirs of an Ex-Minister</i>, vol. ii. p. 188).

<p class="ind">Lord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty
that the tone of the Government Agents in the House of
Commons is less sanguine to-day than it was yesterday with
regard to the issue of the Debate to-night. There are no actual
changes announced of votes, but the tone of the Opposition
is more confident; and when an opinion begins to prevail
that the Government are likely to be in a minority, it often
realises itself by the effect which it produces on waverers and
lukewarm supporters. The Division will certainly take place
to-night; and, without absolutely anticipating failure, Lord
Derby cannot conceal from your Majesty that he considers
the situation very critical. Mr Gladstone expressed privately
his opinion last night that, even if successful on the present
occasion, the Government could not possibly go on, which
does not look like an intention, on the part of the Liberal
Party, of considering the present division as decisive.<sup>47</sup>...</p>

<p class="indright">[<i>Undated. 11th June 1859.</i>]</p>

<p class="ind">I waited at four o'clock this afternoon<a id="footnotetagXXVIII48" name="footnotetagXXVIII48"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVIII48"><sup>48</sup></a> upon the Queen by
Her Majesty's gracious commands. The Queen was pleased
to remark upon the importance of the present crisis. Her
Majesty informed me that Lord Derby had resigned, and that
she had sent for me to desire that I should attempt to form
another Administration, which Her Majesty wished should be
strong and comprehensive. I respectfully assured the Queen
that Her Majesty's commands came upon me by surprise;
that at any time I felt my own insufficiency for such a post,
and that at this time there were special difficulties; that I
believed the only two persons who could form a strong Liberal
Government were either Lord Palmerston or Lord John
Russell; and that, although it had sometimes happened that
two statesmen of equal pretensions preferred having a nominal
chief to serving under one another, I did not believe that this
was the case now. I said that I had reason to believe that
Lords Palmerston and John Russell were ready to co-operate
with one another, while I doubted whether either would
consent to serve under a younger man of such small pretensions
as myself.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen in reply informed me that her first thoughts had
been turned to Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, that
they had both served her long and faithfully, and that Her
Majesty felt it to be an invidious task to select one of the two.
Her Majesty was also of opinion that as different sections of
the Liberal Party were more or less represented by each, it
might be more easy for the Party to act together under a third
person. Her Majesty added that she had selected me as the
Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords, and a
person in whom both Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell
had been in the habit of placing confidence, and she expressed
her confident hope that their attachment to herself would
induce them to yield that assistance without which it would
be difficult to form a strong and comprehensive Government.</p>

<p class="ind">I proceeded to state some of the most salient difficulties of
the task, and asked Her Majesty's permission to ascertain by
negotiation what it would be possible to do.</p>

<p class="ind">Her Majesty informed me that Her Majesty's experience
of former changes of administration had taught her that the
construction of an administration had failed when the person
entrusted with the task had acted merely as a negotiator, and
that the success of other attempts had been owing to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.344" id="pageiii.344"></a>[page&nbsp;344]</span>
acceptance of the charge by the person for whom she had
sent. Her Majesty laid Her Majesty's commands upon me
to make the attempt, and I had the honour of conveying two
letters from Her Majesty to Lord Palmerston and Lord John
Russell, stating that Her Majesty relied upon their assistance.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen gives these lines to Lord Granville, whom she
has entrusted with the task of forming an administration on
the resignation of Lord Derby. She has selected him as the
Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords. She feels
that it is of the greatest importance that both Lord Palmerston
and Lord John Russell should lend their services to the Crown
and country in the present anxious circumstances, and thought
at the same time that they might do so most agreeably to their
own feelings by acting under a third person. They having
both served the Queen long and faithfully as her First Minister,
she must not conceal from Lord Palmerston (John Russell)
that it is a great relief to her feelings not to have to make the
choice of one of them, and she trusts that they will feel no
difficulty to co-operate with one in whom they have both been
in the habit of placing confidence. From the long experience
the Queen has had of Lord Palmerston's (John Russell's)
loyal attachment to her and the service of the Crown, she feels
confident she may rely on Lord Palmerston's (John Russell's)
hearty assistance.<sup>49</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 49: In reply, Lord Palmerston (in a letter printed in Ashley's <i>Life of Lord Palmerston</i>,

Ministry, and undertook to serve under either Lord John Russell or Lord Granville, but
stipulated that any Government he joined must be an efficient and representative one.

<p class="ind">Lord Granville presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs to submit that he saw Lord Palmerston immediately
after he had left Buckingham Palace. Lord Granville stated
what had passed there, omitting any reference to your Majesty's
objection to the effect likely to be produced on the
Continent by Lord Palmerston's name, if he had the direction
of the Foreign Affairs. Nothing could be more frank and
cordial than Lord Palmerston's manner. He agreed to lead
the House of Commons; he said that he had certainly anticipated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.345" id="pageiii.345"></a>[page&nbsp;345]</span>
that your Majesty would have sent for either Lord John
or himself, but having taken a part in the defeat of the present
Government, he felt bound to put aside any personal objects,
and co-operate with me; and that there was no person whom
he should prefer or even like as much as myself. He added
that his co-operation must depend upon my being able to
form a strong Government. Lord Granville then saw Lord
John Russell, and had a very long conversation with him.
Lord John had no objection to serving under Lord Granville,
but thought that he could not give effect to his political views
unless he was either Prime Minister or Leader of the House
of Commons, and he doubted whether he had confidence in
any one but Lord Palmerston for the Foreign Office. Lord
Granville again saw Lord Palmerston, who informed him that
if he had been sent for, he should have objected to go to the
House of Lords, and that he could not now give up the lead
of the House of Commons (which Lord Granville had already
proposed to him to retain) to Lord John. This answer
rendered it unnecessary for Lord Granville to allude to the
objections to his holding the Foreign Office. Lord Granville
has seen Lord Clarendon, who acted up to the full spirit of
your Majesty's letter, but deprecates strongly the attempt to
form a Government without Lord John Russell. Sir George
Grey is of the same opinion. Sir George Lewis, Mr Herbert,
and Mr Gladstone think every effort should be made to secure
Lord John, but that it would not be impossible to form a
Government without him. Mr Milner Gibson, with whom
Lord Granville had a more reserved conversation, considered
it a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> condition of support from the Liberal Party
below the gangway, that Lord John should be a member of
the Government. Lord Granville thinks that in his third
interview with Lord Palmerston he observed more dissatisfaction

<p class="note1">Lord Granville then wrote to Lord John: "I am glad that I wrote to you yesterday
evening, as your answer gave me information which I had not gathered from your conversation
in the morning. I came away from Chesham Place with the impression that
union between you and Palmerston with or without me was impossible. Your letter
afforded a good opportunity of arrangement. As soon as I found by it that I was an
obstacle instead of a facility towards the formation of a strong Government. I went to
the Queen to ask her to excuse me from the task which she had so unexpectedly and so
graciously imposed upon me. In answer to a question, I stated to Her Majesty that it
was disagreeable to me to advise as to which of you and Palmerston she should send for,
but that I was ready to do so if it was her wish.</p>

<p class="note1">"The Queen did not press me. It is a great relief to have finished this business. I
have asked Palmerston to do whatever would strengthen the Government, and assist him
the most as regards myself."

declines entering the Cabinet or taking any <i>other office</i>. He
says, as <i>Foreign</i> Secretary, he should be ready to join the

directed his attention much to general politics, and his taking
any other office, after having held the Foreign Seals during

between her and a Minister in her own room in confidential
intercourse ought to be sacred, and it will be evident to Lord
Granville that if it were not so, the Queen would be precluded
from treating her Ministers with that unreserved confidence
which can alone render a thorough understanding possible;
moreover, any Minister could state what he pleased, against
which the Queen would have no protection, as she could not

accuracy, but in a vulgar, inflated manner, the account which
Lord Granville gave yesterday afternoon to many of his

between them has been that Mr Cobden, against the advice of
all his friends and of his constituents, has decided to decline
taking office. He grounds his decision upon feelings personal
to himself. He thinks that after having so often and so strongly
disapproved of the Foreign Policy of Viscount Palmerston as
tending too much to involve this country in war, it would
be inconsistent for him to join the present Cabinet, and he
also said that, at his time of life and with his general habits,
he does not consider himself fit for administrative office.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston used every [means] in his power to
induce him to change his decision, and showed that, with
respect to present and future action, there is no apparent
difference between his views and those of Mr Cobden, since
both would desire that this country should remain neutral in
the war now raging in Italy. All his arguments, however,
were useless, and though Mr Cobden discussed the matter in
the most friendly and good-humoured manner, and promised
to give out of office all support to the Government, and said
that he thought he could do so more effectually out of office
than in office, he could not be persuaded to make any change
in the answer which he came to give.</p>

She is sorry not to be able to give her assent to his proposal
with regard to Mr Bright.<sup>54</sup> Privy Councillors have sometimes
exceptionally been made without office, yet this has been
as rewards, even in such cases, for services rendered to the
State. It would be impossible to allege any service Mr Bright
has rendered, and if the honour were looked upon as a reward
for his systematic attacks upon the institutions of the country,
a very erroneous impression might be produced as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.350" id="pageiii.350"></a>[page&nbsp;350]</span>
feeling which the Queen or her Government entertain towards
these institutions. It is moreover very problematical whether
such an honour conferred upon Mr Bright would, as suggested,
wean him from his present line of policy, whilst, if he continued

<p class="ind">Lord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs permission to offer to your Majesty his respectful
thanks for your Majesty's most gracious letter of the 18th
of May.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning ventures to believe that he is well able to
figure to himself the feelings with which your Majesty will
have welcomed the termination of the Mutiny and Rebellion
in India, and of the chief miseries which these have brought
in their train. He hopes that your Majesty will not have
thought that there has been remissness in not marking this
happy event by an earlier public acknowledgment and thanksgiving
in India, as has already been done in England.<sup>55</sup> The
truth is, that although this termination has long been steadily
and surely approaching, it is but just now that it can be said
to be complete in the eyes of those who are near to the scene
of action. It is only within the last three weeks that the
exertions of our Troops on the Oudh and Nepaulese frontier,
and in some other parts, have been remitted, and almost every
Gazette has recounted engagements with the rebels, which,
although they have invariably had the same issue, would
scarcely have consisted with a declaration that peace and
tranquillity were restored. Now, however, military operations
have fairly ceased, and the rains and the climate, which would
make a continuance of those operations much to be regretted,
will do their work amongst the rebels who are still in arms in
the Nepaul jungles more terribly than any human avengers.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning has used every exertion and device to bring
these wretched men to submission; but many&mdash;it is difficult to
say how many, but certainly some few thousands&mdash;still hold out.
With some of them the reason no doubt is that they belong to
the most guilty Regiments, and to those which murdered their
officers; but this cannot apply to all; and it is to be feared
that the prevailing cause is the bad influence of their leaders&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.351" id="pageiii.351"></a>[page&nbsp;351]</span>
Nana, Bala Rao, and the Begum;<sup>56</sup> or rather the Begum's

to enquire into the Military Departments, without having
previously communicated with the Queen on the subject.
She is the more surprised at this, as Lord Palmerston told her,
when she saw him on the formation of the present Government,
and she expressed her anxiety on the subject, that there would

The Queen expects that the names of those who it is proposed

<span class="rightnote">CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>5th July 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that the re-appointment of the
Committee on the Organisation of the Military Departments
was unavoidable. That Committee had been affirmed by the
House of Commons and consented to by the late Government,
and had begun its sittings; but when a Dissolution of Parliament
was announced, it suspended its further sittings, with
the understanding that it should be revived in the new Parliament;
and to have departed from that understanding would
have been impossible. That which Viscount Palmerston
intended to convey in what he said to your Majesty on the
subject was, that the evidence given by Lord Panmure might
be deemed as having fully set aside the objection urged against
the present organisation by persons unacquainted with the
bearing upon it of the fundamental principles of the Constitution,
namely, that the Crown acts in regard to Military matters
without having any official adviser responsible for its acts.
Such a condition of things, if it could exist, would be at variance
with the fundamental principles of the British Constitution,
and would be fraught with danger to the Crown, because then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.352" id="pageiii.352"></a>[page&nbsp;352]</span>
the Sovereign would be held personally answerable for administrative
acts, and would be brought personally in conflict in
possible cases with public opinion, a most dangerous condition
for a Sovereign to be placed in.</p>

<p class="ind">The maxim of the British Constitution is that the Sovereign
can do no wrong, but that does not mean that no wrong can
be done by Royal authority; it means that if wrong be done,
the public servant who advised the act, and not the Sovereign,
must be held answerable for the wrongdoing.</p>

<p class="ind">But the Ministers of the Crown for the time being are the
persons who are constitutionally held answerable for all administrative
acts in the last resort, and that was the pith and
substance of the evidence given by Lord Panmure. Those
persons who want to make great changes in the existing
arrangements were much vexed and disappointed by that
evidence, and the attempt made yesterday to put off the Committee
till next year on the ground that the evidence now to
be taken would be one-sided only, and would tend to create
erroneous impressions, was founded upon those feelings of
disappointment.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston submits names of the persons whom
Mr Sidney Herbert proposes to appoint on the Committee, and
they seem to be well chosen.</p>

He has just received from Lord Palmerston, who is here, the

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell has to add that Lord Palmerston and he
are humbly of opinion that your Majesty should give to the
Emperor of the French the moral support which is asked.
It is clearly understood that if the Emperor of Austria declines
to accept the propositions, Great Britain will still maintain
her neutral position.</p>

<p class="ind">But it is probable that her moral support will put an end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.353" id="pageiii.353"></a>[page&nbsp;353]</span>
to the war, and your Majesty's advisers cannot venture to
make themselves responsible for its continuance by refusing
to counsel your Majesty to accept the proposal of France.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 57: At the seat of war, a series of decisive French victories had culminated in the battle
of Solferino, on Midsummer Day (see Introductory Note, <i>ante</i>, <a href="#pageiii.308" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 308</a>). But the French
Emperor was beginning to think these successes too dearly purchased, at the expense of
so many French lives, and, actuated either by this, or some similar motive, he attempted,
on the 6th of July, to negotiate through the British Government with Austria. The
attempt was a failure, but an armistice was signed on the 8th, and again the Emperor
sought the moral support of England. The paper which Lord John Russell submitted
was a rough memorandum of M. de Persigny's, proposing as a basis of negotiation the
cession of Lombardy to Piedmont, the independence of Venetia, and the erection of an
Italian Confederation.

<p class="ind">The Queen has just received Lord John Russell's letter
with the enclosure which she returns, and hastens to say in
reply, that she does not consider the Emperor of the French
or his Ambassador justified in asking the support of England
to proposals he means to make to his antagonist to-morrow.
He made war on Austria in order to wrest her two Italian
kingdoms from her, which were assured to her by the treaties
of 1815, to which England is a party; England declared her
neutrality in the war. The Emperor succeeded in driving
the Austrians out of one of these kingdoms after several
bloody battles. He means to drive her out of the second by
diplomacy, and neutral England is to join him with her moral
support in this endeavour.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen having declared her neutrality, to which her
Parliament and people have given their unanimous assent,
feels bound to adhere to it. She conceives Lord John Russell
and Lord Palmerston ought not to ask her to give her "moral
support" to one of the belligerents. As for herself, she sees
no distinction between moral and general support; the moral
support of England <i>is</i> her support, and she ought to be prepared
to follow it up.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes this letter to be communicated to the

<p class="ind">The Queen has to acknowledge the receipt of Lord John
Russell's letter reporting to her the result of the deliberations
of the Cabinet, which has very much relieved her mind. Lord
John does not say whether her letter was read to the Cabinet,
but from his former letter she concludes it was. She is most
anxious that there should exist no misapprehension on their
part as to the Queen's views. Our position must be consistent
and precisely defined. A negotiation to stop the effusion of
blood, and to attain "a peace which would be for the interests
of all belligerents," is a very vague term. Who is to judge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.354" id="pageiii.354"></a>[page&nbsp;354]</span>
those interests? Is M. de Persigny or the Emperor Napoleon's
opinion to be the guide, as they just now proposed to us?
Austria must be considered the exponent of her own interests.
Prussia has explained to us the interests of Germany in the
maintenance of the line of the fortresses on the Mincio, and was
answered; her views were entirely erroneous, and her apprehensions
exaggerated. It will require the greatest caution on
our part not to lose our neutral position, nor to be made the
advocate of one side. Are the wishes of the Lombards,
Tuscans, etc., really ascertainable, while their countries are
occupied by French and Sardinian armies? The Queen
encloses an extract of a letter from the first Napoleon to his

<span class="rightnote">ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>13th July 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received the news of a concluded peace,<sup>60</sup>
which Lord John Russell has sent to her yesterday, with as
much surprise as it must have caused Lord John. It was
a joyous intelligence, as far as the stopping of the further
effusion of innocent blood and the security against further
diplomatic complications is concerned, but it gives cause for
serious reflection. The Emperor Napoleon, by his military
successes, and great apparent moderation or prudence immediately
after them, has created for himself a most formidable
position of strength in Europe. It is remarkable that he has
acted towards Austria now just as he did towards Russia after
the fall of Sebastopol; and if it was our lot then to be left
alone to act the part of the extortioner whilst he acted that of
the generous victor, the Queen is doubly glad that we should
not now have fallen into the trap, to ask Austria (as friends and
neutrals) concessions which he was ready to waive. He will
now probably omit no occasion to cajole Austria as he has done
to Russia, and turn her spirit of revenge upon Prussia and
Germany&mdash;the Emperor's probable next victims. Should he
thus have rendered himself the master of the entire Continent,
the time may come for us either to obey or to fight him with
terrible odds against us. This has been the Queen's view
from the beginning of this complication, and events have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.355" id="pageiii.355"></a>[page&nbsp;355]</span>
hitherto wonderfully supported them. How Italy is to prosper
under the Pope's presidency, whose misgovernment of his own
small portion of it was the ostensible cause of the war, the
Queen is at a loss to conceive. But the Emperor will be able to
do just as he pleases, being in military command of the country,
and having Sardinia, the Pope, and Austria as his debtors.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen would like this letter to be communicated to
the Cabinet.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE VIEWS OF THE POPE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Rome</span>, <i>17th July 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Some days since a letter from the "Pontifical
Antechamber," directed to "Signor Odoni Russell, Agente
Officioso di Sua Maest&agrave; Britannica," informed me that His
Holiness the Pope desired to see me.</p>

<p class="ind">In consequence I proceeded to the Vatican, and was ushered
into the presence of His Holiness by Monsignore Talbot, the
"Cameriere" in waiting, who immediately withdrew, and
I remained alone with the Pope.</p>

<p class="ind">His Holiness welcomed me with his usual benevolence and
good humour. He seemed very gay, and spoke with more
than customary frankness, so much so indeed that I have
felt some hesitation as to the propriety of submitting what
passed between us to your Lordship. But after mature
reflection, I think it best you should be in possession of an
accurate and conscientious account of the sentiments of
His Holiness in the present important juncture of affairs.</p>

<p class="ind">"Caro mio Russell," the Pope said, "you have been so
long at Naples that I was already thinking of sending after
you to bring you back; we do not like you to leave us, and
the more so as I have heard you were attached to the Mission
of Mr Elliot,<a id="footnotetagXXVIII62" name="footnotetagXXVIII62"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVIII62"><sup>62</sup></a> who is a son of Lord Minto; and if he entertains
the same political views as his father, he is a dangerous
man to the peace of Italy. Now I knew Lord Minto here,
and although he may be a very good man, I do not think
him a man of any capacity, and his doctrines were calculated
to bring on the ruin of Italy."</p>

<p class="ind">I replied, "I cannot agree with your Holiness, for I consider
Lord Minto to be a very clever man, whose honest,
sound, and liberal views, had they been listened to, might
have prevented the crisis which is now convulsing Italy."</p>

<p class="ind">The Pope said, "Well, of course you belong to his party,
but, <i>Poveri noi!</i> what is to become of us with your uncle
and Lord Palmerston at the head of affairs in England?
They have always sympathised with the turbulent spirits
of Italy, and their accession to power will greatly increase
the hopes of the Piedmontese Party. Indeed, I well know
what the English Government want: they want to see the
Pope deprived of his temporal power."</p>

<p class="ind">I replied, "Again I regret to find your Holiness so entirely
mistaken with respect to the policy of England. We derive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.357" id="pageiii.357"></a>[page&nbsp;357]</span>
great happiness from our free institutions, and we would
be glad to see our neighbours in Europe as happy and as
prosperous as we are, but we have no wish to interfere with
the internal concerns of other nations, or to give advice without
being asked for it; least of all as a Protestant Power
would <i>we</i> think of interfering one way or the other with the
Government of your Holiness."</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE POPE ON ENGLISH LIBERALISM</span>
<p class="ind">The Pope said, "I do not doubt the good intentions of
England, but unfortunately you do not understand this
country, and your example is dangerous to the Italian minds,
your speeches in Parliament excite them, and you fancy
because constitutional liberties and institutions suit you,
that they must suit all the world. Now the Italians are a
dissatisfied, interfering, turbulent and intriguing race; they
can never learn to govern themselves, it is impossible; only
see how they follow Sardinia in all she tells them to do, simply
because they love intrigue and revolution, whilst in reality
they do not know what they want; a hot-headed people like
the Italians require a firm and just government to guide
and take care of them, and Italy might have continued
tranquil and contented, had not the ambition of Sardinia
led her to revolutionise the whole country. The Grand Duke
of Tuscany, for instance, is an excellent and just man, and
nevertheless, at the instigation of Piedmont, he was turned
out of the country, and for no earthly purpose. I suppose
you have read Monsieur About's book about Rome<a id="footnotetagXXVIII63" name="footnotetagXXVIII63"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVIII63"><sup>63</sup></a>? well,
all he says is untrue, pure calumny, and it would be easy
for me to have it all refuted; but he is really not worthy of
such an honour. His book, I see, has been translated into
English, and I have no doubt it will be much read and believed
in England. Such books and our refugees mislead your
countrymen, and I often wonder at the language your statesmen
hold about us in the Houses of Parliament. I always
read their speeches. Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell,
and Mr Gladstone do not know us; but when I think how
kindly and hospitably Lord Granville was received at Rome
last winter, and then read the extraordinary speech he made
last February about us, I think the gout he suffered from
here must have gone to his head when he reached England,
and I wonder how Her Majesty the Queen could send for
him to form a Government! Then again, Mr Gladstone,
who allowed himself to be deceived about the Neapolitan
prisoners&mdash;he does not know us and Italy&mdash;and Mr Cobden,&mdash;I
knew him in 1847&mdash;he is always in favour of peace, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.358" id="pageiii.358"></a>[page&nbsp;358]</span>
must be very fond of animals, for when he came here from
Spain he wanted me to write to that country and put a stop
to bull-fights&mdash;a very good man, but I do not know his views
about Italy. And Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, do you think
he will be employed again? he seemed so anxious to get a
place. Mr Disraeli was my friend; I regret him. But tell
me, <i>caro mio Russell</i>, if you are a prophet, how all this war
and fuss is to end?"</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE TEMPORAL POWER</span>
<p class="ind">I replied, "Your Holiness has better claims to being a
prophet than I have, and I sincerely hope all this may end
well for Italy; but as regards the present and the past, I
must again say that I deeply regret to see your Holiness
misconceive the honest views and sincere sympathies of the
statesmen you have named, for the welfare of Italy; they
would like to see Italy independent, prosperous, progressing
and contented, and able to take care of herself without foreign
troops. Your Holiness has done me the honour to speak
freely and openly with me; permit me to do the same, and
ask your Holiness what England must think when she sees
the temporal power of your Holiness imposed upon three
millions of people by the constant presence of French and
Austrian bayonets, and when, after ten years of occupation,
the Austrians withdraw suddenly, there is at once an insurrection
throughout the country; and if the French were to
leave Rome it is generally acknowledged that a revolution
would compel your Holiness to seek refuge in some foreign
country. At the same time, when the troops of your Holiness
are employed as at Perugia,<sup>64</sup> the Government is too weak
to control them; they pillage and murder, and, instead of
investigating their conduct, the excesses committed by them
are publicly rewarded."</p>

<p class="ind">The Pope smiled, paused, took a pinch of snuff, and then
said good-humouredly: "Although I am not a prophet, I
know one thing; this war will be followed by an European
Congress, and a Congress about Italian Affairs is even worse
for us than war. There will be changes in Italy, but mark
my words, whatever these changes are, the Pope will ever
be the Pope, whether he dwells in the Vatican or lives
concealed in the Catacombs.</p>

<p class="ind">"Lastly, I will give you some advice. Prepare and take
care of yourselves in England, for I am quite certain the
French Emperor intends sooner or later to attack you."</p>

<p class="ind">The Pope then beckoned to me to approach, and making
the sign of the Cross, he gave me his blessing in Latin, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.359" id="pageiii.359"></a>[page&nbsp;359]</span>
with both his hands, he took one of mine, pressed it, and said
with great warmth, "Be our friend in the hour of need."

<span class="rightnote">DISAPPOINTMENT OF CAVOUR</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>18th July 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns these interesting letters to Lord John.<sup>65</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The whole aspect of affairs gives cause for serious reflection
and great anxiety for the future.</p>

<p class="ind">The conduct of France as regards Italy shows how little
the Emperor Napoleon cared for, or thought of, its independence
when he undertook this war, which (though in the last
instance begun by Austria) <i>he</i> brought on, for purposes of
his own.</p>

<p class="ind">The manifesto of the Emperor of Austria shows how unfortunate
for her own interests the policy of Prussia has
been.<sup>66</sup> She had made herself answerable for the issue of
the war by restraining the minor states, and stands now
humiliated and isolated. Her position in Germany is at
present very painful, and may be for the future very
dangerous.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen feels strongly that we are not without considerable
responsibility in having from the first urged her
to take no part in the war, which certainly had great influence
on her actions&mdash;and she will very naturally look to us not
to desert her when the evil hour for her may come.<sup>67</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 65: These were letters from Lord Cowley and Sir James Hudson in reference to the Peace
of Villafranca. The former announced, as a result of his conversation with the Empress
and other persons, that among the causes which induced the French Emperor to consent
to peace were his horror at any further sacrifice of life and time, disgust at what he considered
Italian apathy for the cause which the French were upholding, and distrust of
the intentions of the King of Sardinia and Count Cavour. Sir James Hudson described
the unanimous feeling at Turin that the Nationalist cause had been betrayed. Cavour,
he wrote, could obtain no further response to his remonstrances with Napoleon than
"Il fait bien chaud: il fait bien chaud." Moreover, Napoleon knew (continued Sir
James) "that Mazzini had dogged his footsteps to Milan, for, the day before yesterday,
sixty-six Orsini bombshells were discovered there by the chief of the Sardinian police,
who arrested the man (a known follower of Mazzini) who had them. The story is that
he brought them from England for the purpose of using them against the Austrians!!"
Count Cavour, who resigned in disgust and was succeeded by Rattazzi, remained out of
office till the following January.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 66: He stated that he believed he could obtain better terms direct from the French
Emperor than those to which England, Russia, and Prussia were likely to give their
moral support as a basis of mediation.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 67: Lord Cowley wrote to Lord John Russell on the 20th of July:&mdash;</p>

<p class="note1">"... The two Emperors met in the most cordial manner, shaking hands as if no
difference had existed between them. As soon as they were alone, the Emperor of
Austria took the initiative, and stated at once that he was ready to cede to the Emperor
of the French, for the sake of the restoration of peace, the territory which the latter had
conquered, but that he could not do more, giving the reasons which I have mentioned to
your Lordship in former despatches. The Emperor of the French replied that his own
position in France, and the public declarations which he had made, rendered something
in addition necessary: that the war had been undertaken for the freedom of Italy, and
that he could not justify to France a peace which did not ensure this object. The
Emperor Francis Joseph rejoined that he had no objection to offer to the Confederation
which formed part of the Emperor Napoleon's programme, and that he was ready to
enter it with Venetia, and when the Emperor Napoleon remarked that such a result
would be a derision, if the whole power and influence of Austria were to be brought to
bear upon the Confederation, the Emperor Francis Joseph exclaimed against any such
interpretation being given to his words, his idea being that Venetia should be placed
on the same footing, in the Italian Confederation, as Luxemburg holds in the Germanic
Confederation....</p>

<p class="note1">"In the course of conversation between the two Imperial Sovereigns, the Emperor
of Austria remarked to the Emperor of the French with many expressions of goodwill,
and of a desire to see the dynasty of the latter firmly established on the throne of France,
that His Majesty took an odd way to accomplish his end. 'Believe me,' said the Emperor
Francis Joseph, 'dynasties are not established by having recourse to such bad company
as you have chosen; revolutionists overturn, but do not construct.' The Emperor
Napoleon appears to have taken the remark in very good part, and even to have excused
himself to a certain degree, observing that it was a further reason that the Emperor
Francis Joseph should aid him in putting an end to the war, and to the revolutionary
spirit to which the war had given rise.</p>

<p class="note1">"The Emperors having separated in the same cordial manner in which they had met,
the Emperor of the French himself drew up the preliminaries and sent them in the evening
to Verona by his cousin, the Prince Napoleon. Being introduced to the Emperor of
Austria, who received His Imperial Highness very courteously, His Majesty said, after
reading the preliminaries, that he must beg the Prince to excuse him for a short time,
as he had others to consult before signing them. He then went into an adjoining room
where, according to Prince Napoleon's account, a loud and angry discussion ensued,
in which the Prince distinguished the Emperor's voice broken by tears, as if His Majesty
had been obliged to have recourse to persuasion, to silence the opposition made to the
conditions, and it was not until some time had elapsed that His Majesty returned and
signed the paper containing them, or rather I infer that he retained the paper signed
by the Emperor Napoleon, and returned one of similar purport signed by himself; for
among all the curious circumstances connected with this transaction, not the least curious
is the fact that there does not exist any document recording the preliminaries with the
double signature of both Emperors."

Sir C. Wood to consider, with his Council, whether means

they may be called, dependent upon some formal and judicial
proceeding which should secure the Queen from acts being
done in her name&mdash;which might not be entirely justifiable
morally, as well as legally&mdash;which should relieve the Government
agents from the fearful responsibility of being sole
advisers on steps implying judicial condemnation without
trial on their mere personal opinion, and from which they

<span class="rightnote">NON-INTERVENTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>21st August 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sends the enclosed draft to Lord John Russell;
she is very sorry that she cannot give her approval to it.
There are many points in it to which she cannot but feel the
gravest objections. It is unnecessary, however, for her to
go into these details, as it is against the principle of England
volunteering at this moment the intrusion of a scheme of
her own for the redistribution of the territories and Governments
of Northern Italy, that she must above all protest.
Moreover, a step of such importance, reversing the principle of
non-intervention, which the Queen's Government has hitherto
publicly declared and upheld, should, in the Queen's opinion,
not be brought before her without having received the fullest
deliberation and concurrence of the assembled Cabinet.</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 69: A month earlier, on his return from the war, the Emperor had tried to enlist British
support in his scheme for a European congress. But the Cabinet decided (24th July),

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your
Majesty; he begs to explain that with respect to reversing
the principle of non-intervention, he has never proposed
any such course. If intervention were to mean giving friendly
advice, or even offering mediation, your Majesty's Government
from January to May would have pursued a course of
intervention, for they were all that time advising Austria,
France, Sardinia, and Germany.</p>

<p class="ind">If by friendly and judicious advice we can prevent a bloody
and causeless war in Italy we are bound to give such advice.</p>

<p class="ind">If we refrain from doing so, we may ultimately be obliged
to have recourse to intervention; that is to say, we may
have to interfere against the ruthless tyranny of Austria, or
the unchained ambition of France. It is with a view to
prevent the necessity of intervention that Lord John Russell
advises friendly representations.</p>

<p class="ind">... With regard to Lord John's letter of to-day, the
Queen wishes merely to say that from the outbreak of the
war our negotiations have ceased, and that the war is not
over till the peace is concluded. Our interference before that
period may be prompted by a desire to prevent a future
war; but our first duty is not to interfere with the closing
of the present. The desire to guard Italy against "the ruthless
tyranny of Austria, and the unchained ambition of France"
may produce a state of things in Italy, forcing both to make
common cause against her, and backed by the rest of Europe
to isolate England, and making her responsible for the issue.
It will be little satisfaction then to reflect upon the fact that
our interference has been merely <i>advice</i>.</p>

<span class="rightnote">FOREIGN POLICY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">94 Piccadilly</span>, <i>23rd August 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that Lord John Russell has shown
him your Majesty's communication, in which your Majesty
objects to a proposed despatch to Lord Cowley, on the ground
that it would be a departure from the principle of non-intervention
which has been publicly proclaimed as the rule for
Great Britain in the late events between France and Austria.
But Viscount Palmerston would beg humbly to submit to
your Majesty that the intervention which all parties agreed
that this country ought to abstain from, was active interference
by force of arms in the war then going on, but that
neither of the great political parties meant or asserted that
this country should not interfere by its advice and opinions
in regard to the matters to which the war related. Viscount
Palmerston can assert that neither he nor any of those who
were acting with him out of office ever contemplated giving
such a meaning to the doctrine of non-intervention; and
that such a meaning never was attached to it by the Conservative
Leaders while they were in office, is proved from
one end of their Blue Book to the other.<sup>70</sup> The whole course
of the Derby Government, in regard to the matters on which
the war turned, was one uninterrupted series of interventions
by advice, by opinions, and by censure now addressed to
one party and now to another. Whatever may be thought
of the judgment which was shown by them, or of the bias
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.363" id="pageiii.363"></a>[page&nbsp;363]</span>
by which they were guided, the principle on which they acted
was undoubtedly right and proper.</p>

<p class="ind">England is one of the greatest powers of the world, no
event or series of events bearing on the balance of power,
or on probabilities of peace or war can be matters of indifference
to her, and her right to have and to express opinions
on matters thus bearing on her interests is unquestionable;
and she is equally entitled to give upon such matters any
advice which she may think useful, or to suggest any arrangements
which she may deem conducive to the general good.</p>

<p class="ind">It is no doubt true that the Conservative Party, since
they have ceased to be responsible for the conduct of affairs,
have held a different doctrine, and in their anxiety lest the
influence of England should be exerted for the benefit of
Italy, and to the disadvantage of Austria, have contended
that any participation by Great Britain in the negotiations for
the settlement of Italy would be a departure from the principle
of non-intervention; but their own practice while in office
refutes their newly adopted doctrine in opposition; and if that
doctrine were to be admitted, Great Britain would, by her own
act, reduce herself to the rank of a third-class European State.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>24th August 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is really placed in a position of much difficulty,
giving her deep pain. She has been obliged to object to so
many drafts sent to her from the Foreign Office on the Italian
Question, and yet, no sooner is one withdrawn or altered,
than others are submitted exactly of the same purport or
tendency, if even couched in new words. The Queen has so
often expressed her views that she is almost reluctant to
reiterate them. She wishes, however, Lord John to re-peruse<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN AND LORD JOHN RUSSELL</span>
the two drafts enclosed, which just came to her. If they have
any meaning or object, it must be to show to France that it
would be to her interest to break in the Treaty of Zurich the
leading conditions to which she pledged herself to Austria
at Villafranca. Those preliminaries contained but three
provisions affecting Austria: (1) That Austria was to cede
Lombardy; (2) That an Italian Confederation should be encouraged,
of which Venetia was to form part; (3) That the
Dukes of Tuscany and Modena were to return to their Duchies.
The two latter clauses must be considered as compensations
for the losses inflicted in the first. Both the latter are now
to be recommended by England, a neutral in the war, to be
broken.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.364" id="pageiii.364"></a>[page&nbsp;364]</span>

<p class="ind">Now, either it is expected that our advice will not be listened
to, in which case it would not be useful and hardly dignified
to give it, or it is expected that France will follow it. If, on
finding herself cheated, Austria were to feel herself obliged
to take up arms again, we should be directly answerable for
this fresh war. What would then be our alternative? Either
to leave France in the lurch, to re-fight her own battle, which
would entail lasting danger and disgrace on this country,
or to join her in the fresh war against Austria&mdash;a misfortune
from which the Queen feels herself equally bound to protect
her country.</p>

<p class="ind">As this is a question of principle on which she clearly understood
her Cabinet to have been unanimous, she must ask
her correspondence to be circulated amongst its members,
with a view to ascertain whether they also would be parties
to its reversal, and in order to prevent the necessity of these
frequent discussions, which, as the Queen has already said,
are very painful to her.</p>

<span class="rightnote">MEDIATION OF LORD GRANVILLE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>29th August 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;In the middle of last week I received at Aldenham
a letter from Mr Sidney Herbert,<a id="footnotetagXXVIII71" name="footnotetagXXVIII71"></a><a href="#footnoteXXVIII71"><sup>71</sup></a> in which he told me that he
had just received a visit from Lord Palmerston, much perturbed
and annoyed, saying that the Queen had objected to
all Lord John's despatches, and appeared to think that it
was objectionable for England to give any advice on the subject
of Italian affairs. Mr Herbert gave some good advice
to Lord Palmerston, but, from the tone of his letter, I gather
that he thought the objections made at Osborne unreasonable.
I answered that I entirely concurred with him in the interest
of everybody, that no feelings of irritation should exist between
the Sovereign and her leading Ministers; that it was
possible that the Queen, forgetting how very sensitive Lord
John was to criticism, had pulled him up more sharply than
he liked, but that I was convinced the objections made were
not exactly those mentioned by Lord Palmerston. I heard
nothing more till I received on Saturday evening a telegram,
summoning me to a Cabinet this day. I came to Town immediately,
and saw Lord Palmerston yesterday. I enquired
the reason of the sudden summons for a Cabinet. He told
me that there had been a discussion between the Queen and
Lord John; that the Queen had objected to his (Lord John's)
proposal that the despatch of 25th July should be now communicated to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.365" id="pageiii.365"></a>[page&nbsp;365]</span>
the French Government. Lord John had informed
him of the fact, and had requested him to communicate
with the Queen on the subject. Lord Palmerston then read
to me a well-written memorandum on the abstract question of
giving advice, which he had sent to Her Majesty. He told
me that he had been to Osborne; that the Queen had expressed
a wish through Sir Charles Wood that he should not
discuss the whole matter with her; that he had had a satisfactory
conversation with your Royal Highness, of which he
gave me an abstract, which, however, contained his own
arguments at greater length than your Royal Highness's.
He said that Lord John had made a mistake with respect to
the end of the despatch, in which Lord Cowley is desired to
withhold it till after the Peace of Zurich was concluded.
Lord John gave a different interpretation to it from what
appeared to be the case, as described by a previous letter of
Lord John, in which he had said that the sentence was added
at the suggestion of the Cabinet, and with his entire approval.
Lord Palmerston states that the Queen did not feel herself
authorised to sanction a departure from what had been
decided by the Cabinet, without the concurrence of the Cabinet,
and that she thought it desirable, if the Cabinet met, that
they should agree on the future policy as regards Italy. Lord
John also wished for a Cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind">I replied that there seemed to be a double question: first,
a difference between the Queen and Lord John Russell and
himself; and second, the whole question of our Italian Policy.
On the first point I could not but remember the apprehension
generally felt at the formation of his first Government; that
the feeling between the Sovereign and himself might not be
such as to give strength to the Government; that the result,
however, was most satisfactory. I was not aware of either
the Queen or himself having given way on any one point of
principle, but the best understanding was kept up in the most
honourable way to both, and that, at the end of his Ministry,
I knew that the Queen had expressed to several persons how
much she regretted to lose his services. That I most sincerely
hoped that there was no chance of misunderstanding now
arising; that would be most disadvantageous to the Sovereign,
to the public service, to the Government, and, above
all, to himself. He interrupted me by assuring me that there
was not the slightest chance of this. He repeated to me
flattering things said by the Queen at the close of his last
Administration, and told me that it was impossible for the
Queen to have been more kind and civil than at his visit last
week at Osborne. I continued that in Italian matters I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.366" id="pageiii.366"></a>[page&nbsp;366]</span>
believed the Cabinet was agreed. Our language to Italian
Governments ought to show sympathy with Italy, and let
them know that we were anxious that they should be left
free to act and decide for themselves; that it should inform
them in the clearest manner that in no case were they to obtain
active assistance from us, and it ought to avoid giving any
advice as to their conduct, which might make us responsible
for the evil or danger which might accrue from following
such advice. That our language to France and Austria ought
to press upon them in every <i>judicious</i> manner the expediency
of doing that which was likely to secure the permanent happiness
of Italy, and to persuade them to abstain from forcing
upon the Italians, persons and forms of Government to which
they objected; nothing like a menace or a promise to be
used....</p>

<p class="ind">I then saw Sidney Herbert, who told me that Charles
Wood's report had entirely changed the aspect of things;
that it was clear that the Queen had come to the assistance
of the Cabinet, instead of opposing them; that reason had
been entirely on her side, and that Johnny had reduced the
question now to the single point, which was not of much
importance, whether the 25th July despatch should now be
communicated or not. He told me that Lord John was in a
state of great irritation, and ready to kick over the traces.
I dined at Lord Palmerston's, and met Sir Charles Wood and
Mr Gladstone. I had some guarded conversation with the
latter, who seemed very reasonable. Sir Charles Wood gave
me all the information which I required. It appears to me
that the really important point is that the whole Cabinet
should know the real question between the Queen and her
Ministers, and that, if Lord John can find plausible reasons
for changing the date of the communication of the despatch,
it may be better for the Queen to consent to this. Some of
us will take care to have a decided opinion about the future
course of our policy.</p>

<p class="ind">I presume Sir George Grey will be at the Cabinet, and will
be able to report to your Royal Highness what has passed.
If he is not there, I will write again. I have the honour to be,
Sir, with great respect, your Royal Highness's obedient,
humble, and faithful Servant,</p>

of the Cabinet thought that the despatch of 25th July had
not only been sent but communicated. Others attached a
different meaning to the closing paragraph than what it
appears to bear. Lord John produced a most objectionable
draft of despatch in lieu of that of the 25th. It was universally
condemned, and Lord Palmerston was empowered to
tell the Queen that the Cabinet now thought that the despatch
of the 25th might be communicated.</p>

<p class="ind">Lords Palmerston and John Russell asked for further

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell will not be surprised if the despatches
of Lord Cowley and drafts by Lord John in answer to them,
which the Queen returns to him, have given her much pain.
Here we have the very interference with advice to which
the Queen had objected when officially brought before her for
her sanction, to which the Cabinet objected, and which Lord
John Russell agreed to withdraw, carried on by direct communication
of the Prime Minister through the French Ambassador
with the Emperor; and we have the very effect
produced which the Queen dreaded, viz. the French Minister
insinuating that we called upon his master to do that which
he would consider so dishonourable that he would rather
resign than be a party to it! What is the use of the Queen's
open and, she fears, sometimes wearisome correspondence,
with her Ministers, what the use of long deliberations of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.368" id="pageiii.368"></a>[page&nbsp;368]</span>
Cabinet, if the very policy can be carried out by indirect
means which is set aside officially, and what protection has
the Queen against this practice? Lord John Russell's
distinction also between his own official and private opinion
or advice given to a Foreign Minister is a most dangerous,
and, the Queen thinks, untenable theory, open to the same
objections, for what he states will have the weight of the
official character of the Foreign Secretary, whether stated as
his private or his public opinion. His advice to the Marquis
d'Azeglio<sup>73</sup> is moreover quite open to the inference drawn
by Count Walewski, that it is an encouragement to <i>Sardinia</i>,
to Military intervention in and occupation of the Duchies,
and Lord John Russell's answer hardly meets this point if
left as it stands at present; for "the <i>name</i> of the King of
Sardinia,... <i>the chief of a well-disciplined army</i>," will have
little influence unless he is prepared to use that army.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must ask Lord John to instruct Lord Cowley
to state to Count Walewski that no opinions expressed on
Foreign Policy are those of "Her Majesty's Government"
but those which are given in the official and regular way, and
that Her Majesty's Government never thought of advising
the French Government to break the solemn engagements
into which the Emperor Napoleon entered towards the
Emperor of Austria at Villafranca.</p>

Lord Palmerston.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns Lord Palmerston's letter, together with
the other papers sent to her, to Lord John. She is glad to
find that he thinks that no answer ought to be given to Count
Persigny, but she thinks it important that it should be <i>stated
to him that no answer can be given</i>. Unfortunately, here has
been again the Prime Minister declaring that he <i>quite agrees</i>
with the French Ambassador, but that the proposal should
come officially from France to be placed before the Cabinet.
The inference must be that the Cabinet and the Queen will,
as a matter of course, agree also, when it is so submitted.
Now what is it that Lord Palmerston has approved? A
plan for an alliance of England with France for the purpose
of <i>overruling</i> Austria, if the Duchies in which she is the heir,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.369" id="pageiii.369"></a>[page&nbsp;369]</span>
and to which the Archdukes were to return in accordance
with the stipulations of Villafranca, were given to Sardinia
and Austria should object. It is hoped indeed that this will
not immediately lead to war with her, but France is to expect
that she will not be left to fight single-handed for an object
declared to be more English than French! Thus we are
dragged step by step into the position of a party in the Italian
strife. The Queen thinks it incumbent upon her not to leave
Lord John Russell in ignorance of the fact that <i>she</i> could
not approve such a policy reversing our whole position since
the commencement of the War.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must leave it to Lord John to consider how far
it would be fair to his colleagues in the Cabinet to leave them
unacquainted with the various private steps lately taken,
which must seriously affect their free consideration of the
important question upon which they have hitherto pledged
themselves to a distinct principle.</p>

her letter to him on this subject. She has nothing to add,
but to repeat her conviction of the great danger and inconvenience
arising out of such private communications, and
the apprehension she must naturally feel that the attempt
to convince the Emperor Napoleon that it would be for his
interest to break his word to the Emperor of Austria should
reflect upon the honour of the Queen's Government. She
must insist upon this being distinctly guarded against.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Abergeldie</span>, <i>7th September 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your
Majesty; he cannot refrain from making some remarks on
your Majesty's letter of yesterday.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Palmerston appears to have answered M. de Persigny
by saying that he personally agreed with him, but that the
proposition he had sketched must come from the French
Government; that it must come from them officially, and it
would then have to be maturely considered by the Cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell sees nothing to object to in this language.
It might be embarrassing to Lord Palmerston if such a proposition
were to come from France, and were to be rejected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.370" id="pageiii.370"></a>[page&nbsp;370]</span>
by the Cabinet. But Lord Palmerston could easily explain
the matter to M. de Persigny. Lord Palmerston does not
appear to have committed your Majesty, or Lord John
Russell, or the Cabinet in any way.</p>

<p class="ind">On the other hand, your Majesty cannot mean that the
Cabinet is to be precluded from maturely considering any
proposition which may come officially from France.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell feels, on his own part, that he must
offer to your Majesty such advice as he thinks best adapted
to secure the interests and dignity of your Majesty and the
country. He will be held by Parliament responsible for that
advice. It will be always in your Majesty's power to reject
it altogether.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell is of opinion that there never was a
time when it was less expedient to fetter this country by prospective
engagements. But it does not follow that the policy
pursued last autumn and winter, and which ended in a war
in Italy, would be the best course in any future contingency.
Should another war arise it will be very difficult for Great
Britain to remain neutral. For this reason it is desirable to
prevent such a war, if possible. It was difficult last winter,
and may be still more difficult this winter. For the present
there is no better course than to keep this country free from
engagements. After the peace of Zurich is made, or not
made, we shall see our way better.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell has never concealed his opinions from
his colleagues. He even warned them that France might
make such a proposition as M. de Persigny now contemplates.</p>

<p class="ind">The enclosed letter from Lord Palmerston and Mr Fane's<sup>74</sup>
despatch will show the feelings which exist between Austria
and Prussia. The Emperor Napoleon does not appear to
have satisfied Prince Metternich. His object evidently is
to gain time.</p>

break his word, Viscount Palmerston cordially subscribes
to that opinion, and maintains that he has not done so in the

Palmerston is to be debarred from communicating with Foreign
Ministers except for the purpose of informing them officially
of formal decisions of the British Government, Viscount
Palmerston would beg humbly and respectfully to represent
to your Majesty that such a curtailment of the proper and

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S OPINION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Balmoral</span>, <i>11th September 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Palmerston has written (on the 8th) a long letter
to the Queen, which, besides giving his private opinion on
the politics of Italy, which were not disputed, purports to
show that when a principle of policy had been adopted by
the Cabinet and sanctioned by the Sovereign, the Foreign
Secretary ought not to be impeded in carrying out the details,
either by objections raised to them by the Sovereign, or by
making them dependent on the meetings of Cabinets, difficult
to obtain at this time of year. Now the question raised by
the Queen was <i>just the reverse</i>. The principle adopted by the
Cabinet and sanctioned by the Queen was: not to interfere
by active advice with the peace to be made at Zurich; the
Foreign Secretary had submitted a draft which had appeared
to the Queen to be in contradiction to this principle, which,
upon the Sovereign's objection, he withdrew; the Cabinet
was summoned and rejected a similar draft submitted to them,
and the Queen then complained that the very same advice
should have been given by the Prime Minister in an indirect
way to which the Sovereign and Cabinet could not agree
openly. Lord Palmerston's letter was not communicated
to the Queen until it had been alluded to in a public despatch,
and Count Walewski had insinuated to our Ambassador that,
rather than be a party to a line of conduct, which he would
look upon as dishonourable for his master, he would resign
office. What the Queen has asked for is: an intimation to
the French Government that private communications like
that of Lord Palmerston to M. de Persigny must not be looked
upon as the official expression of the opinion of Her Majesty's
Government, and that we disclaim ever having intended to
induce the Emperor to break his engagements made at Villafranca,
whatever they may have been. The Queen does not
conceive that Lord Palmerston can object to this course,
nor does he attempt to do so in his letter.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Since writing the above the Queen has received
Lord Palmerston's letter of the 9th. As she has just written
at length, she does not conceive that it would be necessary
to make any further observations in reply, except to a distinct
question put by him in the latter part of his letter, viz.
what the Queen wishes to have "distinctly guarded against."</p>

<p class="ind">It is the danger and inconvenience of private communications
with Foreign Ministers, without a distinct understanding
that they are strictly private, and not to be treated as conveying
the opinions of Her Majesty's Government, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.373" id="pageiii.373"></a>[page&nbsp;373]</span>
sanction of the Crown and adhesion of the Cabinet have not
been obtained. Lord John Russell has now expressed this
in a paragraph in one of his drafts to Lord Cowley, which he
will send to Lord Palmerston.</p>

<p class="ind">As a proof of the necessity of such caution, the Queen,
has only to refer to the public use made of Lord Palmerston's
private letter to Count Persigny, and the use made to our
prejudice by the Emperor Napoleon at the time of the armistice
at Villafranca of a private communication with Count Persigny,
which was represented to imply assent to certain conditions
of peace by England, with a desire of pressing them on Austria,
when no opinion had been expressed by the Government to
justify such an inference.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty;
he has written to Lord Cowley, according to your Majesty's
gracious permission. The question of supporting the Emperor
of the French, if Austria should attempt force to impose a
government in Italy against the popular will, must be judged
of according to the circumstances, should they arise. Lord
John Russell is certainly not prepared to say that a case
may not arise when the interests of Great Britain might
require that she should give material support to the Emperor
of the French. But he considers such a case as very improbable,
and that the fear of such an alliance will prevent
Austria from disturbing the peace of Europe.</p>

of our joining France in a fresh Italian war or demonstration

were allowed to believe in such a possibility, he would have
it in his power to bring it about, or obtain a just cause of
complaint against us, if we abandoned him. It would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.375" id="pageiii.375"></a>[page&nbsp;375]</span>
just as dangerous and unfair towards the Emperor to mislead
him in this respect as it would be for the Queen to conceal
from Lord John that under no pretence will she depart from
her position of neutrality in the Italian quarrel, and inflict
upon her country and Europe the calamity of war on that
account.</p>

<span class="rightnote">SIR JAMES HUDSON</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>6th December 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter recommending
Sir James Hudson<sup>78</sup> as the Second Representative
at the Congress of Paris. The Queen must decline sanctioning
this selection. Lord John Russell has in his last letters
avowed his conviction that England cannot again remain
neutral in an Italian war, and his opinion that she ought to
support France and Sardinia by arms if Austria were to
attempt to recover her supremacy by force. Lord Cowley
wrote on the 29th ult. that Prince Metternich declared that
Austria kept her Army ready because she could not permit
either the military occupation of the Duchies by Sardinia
or their annexation to that kingdom. Lord Palmerston sent
to the Queen yesterday evening the copy of a letter he wrote
to Count Persigny urging the Emperor Napoleon by every
argument he can find to consent to this annexation, even to
the length of assuring him that such a state would always
be obliged to lean on France.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen cannot help drawing her conclusions from these
facts, and feels more than ever the great responsibility resting
on her, to preserve to her people the blessings of peace. She
wishes this letter to be communicated to Lord Palmerston
and to the Cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen approves of Lord Cowley as her First Representative
at the Congress.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 78: Sir James Hudson, Minister at Turin, had been a sympathiser in the policy of Cavour,
to an extent almost incompatible with his position as a British representative.

<span class="rightnote">CENTRAL ITALY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>7th December 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday.
Although to avoid a long written discussion, she has
not in her last letter stated any reason for her objecting to
Sir James Hudson as Plenipotentiary at the Congress, she
has no objection to state to Lord John that it is simply her
want of confidence in him, being the result of her having
watched his conduct at his post at Turin during these last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.376" id="pageiii.376"></a>[page&nbsp;376]</span>
years. The Queen's representative at Paris ought to be a
person in whom she can have entire confidence, that <i>English</i>
interests alone will sway his conduct. From Lord John
Russell's letter it appears that many of his colleagues in
Cabinet saw equal objections to the appointment.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen repeats her wish that her letter of yesterday
may be communicated to the Cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Cowley's letter, which she returns, is not calculated
to diminish the Queen's alarm as to the direction in which
we are being systematically driven, viz. <i>War</i> to support the
Emperor Napoleon, who almost claims such support already
as his right! He has already shifted his ground further,
and asks for it in case Austria should oppose "the armed
interference of Sardinia in the affairs of Central Italy." Now
Sardinia can have no more right to such interference than
Austria; yet the Emperor says "he is quite determined to
renew the war in case Austria resists." It is under these
circumstances that the advice of the Prime Minister of England
to the Emperor, to withdraw the only impediment which
restrains the action of Sardinia, becomes a matter of such
grave moment.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is determined to hold to her neutrality in the
Italian intrigues, revolutions, and wars. It is true, Lord
John says, "it becomes a great power like Great Britain
to preserve the peace of Europe, by throwing her great weight
into the scale which has justice on its side." But where
justice lies, admits of every variety of opinion.</p>

<p class="ind">The Party placed in absolute power by a revolution and
a foreign invasion is not necessarily the exponent of the real
wishes of a people, and Lord Cowley reports Mr Layard "hot
from Italy to confirm him in the opinion he has always held,
that the annexation of Tuscany to Sardinia is not practicable."
This, however, Lord Palmerston urges, and if it be agreed
to by the Emperor and attempted by Sardinia, Lord John
would probably wish England to fight for it as the cause of
justice.</p>

<p class="ind">Has Lord John ever contemplated the probability of Austria
not being abandoned a second time by Germany, when attacked
by France? The Emperor is sure to have calculated
upon this, and has not played his game badly, if he can get
the Alliance of England to sanction and foster his attack upon
the Rhine, which would inevitably follow. The Queen believes
this to be a cherished object of France, and the success
certain if we become her dupes. The Queen can hardly
for a moment bring herself to think of the consequences.</p>

<p class="ind">She would wish this letter also to be shown to the Cabinet.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">London</span>, <i>8th December 1859</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Lord John stated in what appeared to me a very fair
way what had taken place between himself and Lord Palmerston
in their communications with Her Majesty, and read Her
Majesty's letters. At the end of his statement the Chancellor
asked what was the question to be decided by the Cabinet.
Lord John answered that he wished to know whether he was
to inform Her Majesty that the Cabinet were of opinion that
they were still respectfully of opinion that Sir James Hudson
was the fittest person to be named Second Plenipotentiary, or
whether he should acquiesce in Her Majesty's commands,
reserving his own opinion as to the fitness of Sir James. The
Chancellor answered: "Undoubtedly the second course will
be the best." I then stated my reasons, or rather repeated
them, for objecting to Sir James Hudson. Mr Gladstone
made a hesitating remark. Sir G. Lewis and the Duke of
Argyll, Sir Charles Wood, and Sir George Grey&mdash;the latter
very strongly&mdash;supported the second course proposed by Lord
John. Lord Palmerston spoke with some temper and dogmatically
as to who were right and who were wrong, but
advised Lord John to take the second course. The appointment
of Lord Wodehouse<sup>79</sup> was proposed. Some of us do not
think it a very good one, but there are no sufficient grounds for
our opposing it. I am not sure that Gladstone would not go
any lengths in supporting Lords Palmerston and John Russell
on the Italian Question, although he is more cautious than
they are. The feeling of the rest of the Cabinet, as far as I
can judge, is perfectly sound about war, and on our taking
an English and not a purely Sardinian attitude; but they
are all inclined to sympathise with the national feeling in
Italy, and averse to the restoration of the Dukes by force or
by intrigue.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John was sore and nervous, but talked of his letter to
the Queen, and Lord Palmerston's to Persigny, as "unlucky."
Lord Palmerston seems convinced that he is perfectly in
the right, and everybody else in the wrong, and would, I
am sure, take advantage of any step, taken without sufficient
consideration by the Queen, to make a stand for his own
policy....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes to ask the Lord Chancellor whether no
steps can be taken to prevent the present publicity of the

must necessarily increase when the new law becomes more and

almost impossible for a paper to be trusted in the hands of
a young lady or boy. None of the worst French novels from

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXIX</h3>


<p>At the end of 1859, Mr Cobden had offered his services to the
Government to negotiate a commercial treaty with France, and
had been warmly encouraged in the scheme by Mr Gladstone. In
January 1860, he was officially appointed a Plenipotentiary, with
Lord Cowley, for this purpose, and on the 23rd of that month the
treaty was signed. It included mutual remissions and reductions
of import duties, and was contingent on obtaining the assent of the
British Parliament, but neither party was fettered by any engagement
not to extend similar concessions to other countries. In
February, on the introduction of the Budget, the treaty was brought
before the House of Commons, and ratified by a great majority;
at the same time Mr Gladstone abolished a large number of import
duties, but increased the income-tax for incomes over &pound;150, from
ninepence to tenpence in the pound. His proposal to repeal the paper
duties was rejected by the Peers, the majority in its favour in the
Commons having sunk to nine. A Commons Committee was appointed
to deal with this conflict between the Houses, and resolutions
defining the powers of the Peers in money bills were passed by the
Lower House, Lord Palmerston clearly showing himself in sympathy
with the Lords. Mr Gladstone expressed a desire to resign, in
consequence of his difference with his colleagues, while Lord Derby
and Lord Malmesbury intimated privately that they would support
Lord Palmerston in office against any Radical secession. A Reform
Bill of Lord John Russell, reducing the Borough Franchise to &pound;6,
and making a moderate redistribution of seats, was received with
indifference, and eventually dropped.</p>

<p>Italian affairs mainly absorbed the attention of the country. The
intended international congress was abandoned, owing to the attitude
adopted by the French Emperor towards the Pope, but the former now
obtained the annexation of Savoy and Nice, not, as had been arranged
in 1858 as a reward for assisting to set Italy free "from the
Alps to the Adriatic"&mdash;an ideal which had not been realised&mdash;but
as a price for assisting Piedmont to incorporate the Central Italian
Provinces. The annexation was strongly resented, and suspicions
of French designs were aroused to such an extent as to give a substantial
impetus to the Volunteer movement in this country. By
the summer, 130,000 Volunteers had been enrolled, and, at a review
in Hyde Park, 21,000 men marched past the Queen, while in August,
in consequence of the same apprehensions, it was decided by a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.380" id="pageiii.380"></a>[page&nbsp;380]</span>
vote to carry out the recommendations of the National Defence
Commission.</p>

<p>The Swiss made an ineffectual protest against the annexation of
that part of Savoy which had been neutralised by the treaty of Vienna,
while, on the other hand, the Emperor Napoleon maintained that
the people of Savoy and Nice had the same right to transfer their
country to France, as Tuscany and the &AElig;milia (under which name
the Duchies of Parma and Modena and the Romagna were now
united) had to place themselves under the King of Sardinia. This
they decided in March, by universal suffrage, to do; a few days later
the treaty for the annexation of Savoy and Nice was signed, and in
April it was ratified in the Piedmontese Parliament, Garibaldi, the
deputy for Nice, his native town, voting against it. In the same
month, a <i>pl&eacute;biscite</i>, taken in the provinces affected, showed an
immense majority in favour of annexation. Garibaldi himself was
soon afterwards engaged in rendering assistance to the Sicilians in
their insurrection against the despotic King Francis II. Assuming
the title of "Dictator of Sicily, in the name of Victor Emmanuel,"
Garibaldi attacked and occupied Palermo, and having established
his ascendency in the island, invaded the Neapolitan territory on the
mainland. The Sardinian Government, for diplomatic reasons,
disavowed the expedition, but gave a retrospective assent to it later
in the year.</p>

<p>The French Emperor's policy in Syria added to the distrust with
which he was regarded. The Maronites, a Christian tribe, had been
attacked and massacred by the Druses, and the Emperor had proposed
to send troops to restore order. This step was eventually
taken, after a European conference had been held; but the Emperor's
proposal was so severely criticised that he wrote a long letter to the
French Ambassador in London, reviewing and justifying his policy
in Italy and elsewhere, since the Peace of Villafranca.</p>

<p>Garibaldi had ignored the instructions of Victor Emmanuel to
abstain from further operations against Naples, until the two Sicilies
had voted for absorption into United Italy; King Francis fled to
Ga&euml;ta, and Garibaldi entered the capital. At the same time,
Cavour, in spite of a French protest, determined upon the invasion
of the Papal States, and acted so promptly that in three weeks all
effective opposition to the Italian cause in that territory was put
down, and Umbria and the Marches were conquered. In October,
the Piedmontese Parliament voted for the annexation of such of the
southern Italian provinces as should declare themselves in favour
of it; the Two Sicilies having accepted the offer by overwhelming
majorities, the King and Garibaldi joined hands at Teano, and
finally defeated the Bourbon army, afterwards entering Naples.
The Marches and Umbria also declared for incorporation in the new
Kingdom.</p>

<p>In July, the Prince of Wales, accompanied by the Duke of Newcastle,
left England for a tour in Canada, where he was welcomed with
unbounded enthusiasm; he afterwards proceeded to the United
States, visiting New York, Chicago, and other great cities, being
received by President Buchanan at Washington. The Prince returned
home in the course of November.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.381" id="pageiii.381"></a>[page&nbsp;381]</span>

<p>The Abolitionist troubles, which for some time had been acute
in the States, came to a crisis in the last days of the year, South
Carolina adopting autonomous ordinances, declaring her own independence
and sovereignty as a State, and her secession from the
Union.</p>

<p>The refusal of the Chinese Government to ratify the Treaty of
Tien-tsin, and an unwarranted attack on certain British ships, led
to a revival of hostilities. A desire being expressed by the Chinese
to resume negotiations, some of the British representatives despatched
for that purpose were treacherously captured, and treated with great
cruelty. The allied troops of England and France thereupon,
marched to Pekin, when reparation was made, and retribution,
exacted for the outrages. A Convention was eventually signed on
the 24th of October.</p>

plays with great taste and feeling, and I purchased a fine
Parisian piano to enable him to go on satisfactorily.</p>

<p class="ind">Now I must speak a little of passing events. Louis Napoleon
wished for a Congress because it would have placed a
new authority between himself and the Italians, whom he
fears evidently concerning their fondness of assassinating
people. The pamphlet, "The Pope and the Congress,"
remains <i>incomprehensible</i><sup>1</sup>; it will do him much harm,
and will deprive him of the confidence of the Catholics
who have been in France his most devoted supporters. Now
the Congress is then postponed, but what is to be done with
Italy? One notion is, that there would be some arrangement
by which Piedmont would receive more, Savoy would go to
France, and England would receive Sardinia. I am sure
that England would by no means wish to have Sardinia. It
will give me great pleasure to hear what Lord Cowley has
reported on these subjects. I understand that Louis Napoleon
is now much occupied with Germany, and studies its resources.
This is somewhat alarming, as he had followed, it seems, the
same course about Italy. <i>Gare la bombe</i>, the Prussians may say.
One cannot understand why Louis Napoleon is using so many
odd subterfuges when plain acting would from the month of
September have settled everything. I must say that I found
Walewski at that time very sensible and conservative. His
retiring will give the impression that things are now to be
carried on in a less conservative way, and people will be much
alarmed. I know Thouvenel, and liked him, but that was in
the poor King's time. In England his nomination will not give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.383" id="pageiii.383"></a>[page&nbsp;383]</span>

Pope should be deprived of his temporal dominions, Rome excepted. Its publication
brought about the resignation of Count Walewski (who was succeeded by M. de Thouvenel)
and the abandonment of the proposed Congress.

by finding a proposal to call upon France and Austria not to
interfere in Italy substituted for the former one implying war
on our part for the defence of the Provisional Governments
of Central Italy. The Queen must consider this new proposal,
however, as partial and incomplete as long as Sardinia is not
asked as well to abstain from interference. Austria has
reversionary rights in Tuscany and Modena, Sardinia has no
rights at all, if a desire for acquisition is not to be considered
as one. Austria will probably say she has no intention of
interfering as long as Sardinia does not, but she cannot allow
Sardinia to possess herself of her inheritance under her very
eyes. It is also incorrect to place France and Austria entirely
in the same line; Austria being an Italian power in virtue of
Venetia, and France having nothing whatever to do in Italy.</p>

he stated that the question was whether the people of Naples and of the Roman States
took up arms against their Government for good reasons; and of this matter, he added,
the people themselves were the best judges.

or even an allusion to what she had written, viz. that Austria
and France being asked to abstain from interference, such an
arrangement would be partial and incomplete unless Sardinia
was pledged also to non-interference. The Queen cannot make
out what the doctrines of the Revolution of 1688 can have to
do with this, or how it would necessitate Lord John to abjure
them.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;Your dear letter of the 13th reached
me on Saturday, and I at once forwarded your letter to good
and faithful Clark, who was for <i>two</i> months unable to attend
us from a severe attack of illness, but who is, I am happy to
say, much better, indeed his own good self again, and who is
now <i>here</i>.<sup>3</sup> This good account you give us of your precious

<p class="ind">Affairs are in a sad and complicated state, and though we
modify matters as much as we <i>can</i>, we can't entirely keep our
Ministers (<i>the two</i>) from doing <i>something</i>. You will hear no
doubt of the last proposal soon, viz. that France and Austria
should <i>both</i> agree <i>not</i> to interfere in Italy&mdash;France withdrawing
her troops from Rome, and Sardinia to be asked not
to send any troops into the Duchies until there has been a
<i>final vote</i> expressive of their wishes. We could <i>not prevent</i>
this <i>proposal</i>, which I doubt being accepted&mdash;as the rest of the
Cabinet thought it could <i>not</i> be opposed, and entailed <i>no</i>
material <i>support</i>. This country <i>never</i> would consent to be
entangled in a <i>war</i> for this Italian quarrel....</p>

<span class="rightnote">ANNEXATION OF SAVOY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>21st January 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the enclosed important letter from Lord
Cowley, and Lord John Russell's answers&mdash;documents which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.385" id="pageiii.385"></a>[page&nbsp;385]</span>
she trusts will be communicated to the Cabinet. The Emperor
shows unwillingness to evacuate Rome and Lombardy, disinclination
to admit of the annexation of the Duchies to
Sardinia, a feeling that he could not do so without appearing
dishonourable in the eyes of Austria, and a determination to
rob Sardinia of Savoy in order to repay the French Nation for
the rupture with the Pope, and the abandonment of a protective
tariff by the reconquest of at least a portion of the
"<i>fronti&egrave;res naturelles de la France</i>."<sup>4</sup> Lord Cowley's letter
proves clearly that it is (as the Queen all along felt and often
said) most dangerous for us to offer to bind ourselves to a
common action with the Emperor with regard to Italy, whilst
he has entered into a variety of engagements with the
different parties engaged in the dispute, of which we know
nothing, and has objects in view which we can only guess at,
and which have not the good of Italy in view, but his own
aggrandisement to the serious detriment of Europe.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to Lord John Russell's answer, the Queen will
only say that our proposal having been made by us after
serious reflection and the anxious discussion of the Cabinet
and the Queen, no deviation from it ought to take place
without affording them ample opportunity to consider the
bearings and probable results of such alteration.</p>
<span class="rightnote">VICTOR EMMANUEL</span>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 4: The cession by King Victor Emmanuel of Savoy (the cradle of his race) and of Nice
to France was the consideration offered at Plombi&egrave;res for obtaining French support to
the movement for freeing Italy "from the Alps to the Adriatic"; that result not having
been achieved, a like price was now offered for French assistance in effecting the annexation
of the Central Italian provinces.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>22nd January 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Palmerston's note and enclosures.
She rather expects to be advised by her Ministers
as to the course to be adopted in matters which may lead
to angry debate in the House of Lords, than to give personal
directions on a case so incompletely placed before her; Lord
Willoughby's letter does not even name the persons in question
nor the grounds upon which he assumes "they would not
be received at Court."<sup>5</sup> The Queen does not know how far
admission or non-admission trenches upon the privileges of
the House; from the submitted printed regulation, however,
she would gather that the Lord High Chamberlain has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.386" id="pageiii.386"></a>[page&nbsp;386]</span>
full power to admit or exclude. If Lord Palmerston were to
see Lord Granville as Leader, and the Lord Chancellor as
Speaker, of the House of Lords together with Lord Willoughby,
they might so far discuss the question as to enable Lord
Palmerston to submit a decision for the Queen's consideration
to-morrow.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 5: Lord Willoughby's question had reference to a Peeress, who, he thought, would not
be received at Court. The difference between a State Opening of Parliament and a
Drawing-room was pointed out in Lord Palmerston's reply. Though it would be "unpleasant
to the Peeresses to find themselves sitting next to a person with whom they do
not associate," the Premier advised no interference with the lady in question, if she
persisted in attending.

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>9th February 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has attentively read Lord Canning's letter and
enclosure. She quite agrees in his proposal as to the nature
of the Order of Chivalry to be instituted, and the details which
he recommends with regard to it. She also thinks that titles
should be confined to those now known and borne in India,
and to be given sparingly; but would object to the illimited
power of the Governor-General and Viceroy in this respect.
The highest dignities and titles ought to proceed directly from
the Crown at the Viceroy's recommendation. The Queen
concurs in the view that honours cannot well be made hereditary
amongst Hindoos and Mussulmans, but where Princes
(as we may hope will be the case sometimes hereafter) have
become Christians, the hereditary nature of honours should
not be withheld.<sup>7</sup> ...</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 7: Lord Canning had written that he thought it would be best to adhere to the precise
titles already in use in India, and that they should be at the direct disposal of the Queen's
Representative, without reference to the Crown. He did not recommend that titles
should be hereditary (except in very special cases), in a country where primogeniture was
not established. As to the proposed Order of Knighthood, Lord Canning thought that
the institution of such an Order would be both expedient and opportune. He recommended
that it should include both British-born and Native subjects.

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN AND HER MINISTERS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>10th February 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sends a letter to Lord Palmerston which she has
received yesterday evening from Lord John Russell.<sup>8</sup> She
is induced to do so from a feeling that it is to Lord Palmerston,
as head of the Government, that she has to look, when she
may have reason to take exception to the tone of communications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.388" id="pageiii.388"></a>[page&nbsp;388]</span>
she may receive from members of his Cabinet. Lord
Palmerston will not fail to perceive that the enclosed is not
the kind of communication which the Foreign Secretary
ought to make, when asked by his Sovereign to explain the
views of the Cabinet upon a question so important and momentous
as the annexation of Savoy to France, and the steps
which they propose to take with regard to it. She need not
remind Lord Palmerston that in her letter communicated to
the Cabinet she had given no opinion whatever upon Italian
liberation from a foreign yoke, nor need she protest against
a covert insinuation, such as is contained in Lord John's
letter, that she is no well-wisher of mankind and indifferent
to its freedom and happiness. But she must refer to the constitutional
position of her Ministers towards herself. They
are responsible for the advice they gave her, but they are
bound fully, respectfully, and openly to place before her the
grounds and reasons upon which their advice may be founded,
to enable her to judge whether she can give her assent to that
advice or not. The Government must come to a standstill
if the Minister meets a demand for explanation with an answer
like the following: "I was asked by the Cabinet to give an
answer, but as I do not agree with you, I think it useless to
explain my views."</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen must demand that respect which is due from
a Minister to his Sovereign. As the Queen must consider
the enclosed letter as deficient in it, she thinks Lord John
Russell might probably wish to reconsider it, and asks Lord
Palmerston to return it to him with that view.</p>

<p class="ind">That Lord Palmerston may be acquainted with the course
the correspondence has taken, the Queen encloses the two
preceding letters.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 8: The letter ran:&mdash;"Lord John Russell unfortunately does not partake your Majesty's
opinions in regard to Italy, and he is unwilling to obtrude on your Majesty unnecessary
statements of his views.... Whatever may be the consequence, the liberation of the
Italian people from a foreign yoke is, in the eyes of Lord Palmerston and Lord John
Russell, an increase of freedom and happiness at which as well-wishers to mankind they
cannot but rejoice."

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that Mr Gladstone made this
afternoon his financial statement.<sup>9</sup> His speech lasted three
hours, from five to eight, and was admirable, detailed, clear,
comprehensive and eloquent; and he did not appear to be
fatigued by the effort.<sup>10</sup> The statement was well received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.389" id="pageiii.389"></a>[page&nbsp;389]</span>
by the House, and though parts of the arrangement may,
and no doubt will, be disputed and attacked as the various
measures of which the arrangement is composed, pass through
the House, there seems to be a fair probability that the Government
will not sustain any serious defeat upon any part of the
arrangement. The scheme is too extensive and complicated
to admit of an abstract of it being given to your Majesty in
this Report; but no doubt a condensed summary of it will
be given in the newspapers of to-morrow.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 9: The Budget of 1860 was contemporaneous with the commercial treaty with France
negotiated by Mr Cobden, reducing <i>inter alia</i> the import duties on French wine and
brandy, and English coal, flax, and pig-iron. Mr Gladstone abolished the duties on a
large number of imports, and proposed to repeal that on paper (regarded not only as a
means for the diffusion of knowledge, but a commodity in various industries).</p>

illness.

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 11: In this despatch, Lord John wrote that the Government could not believe that a
country in the circumstances of France could be endangered by the existence, "on the
other side of the Alps, of a State of 11,000,000 of people lately joined by a cement not
yet dry, threatened, on the side of Lombardy, by Austria, and not very certain of its own

and nervous. We all criticised the draft. We thought it
too much or too little. We recommended that he should
either write shortly, saying that he did not acquiesce in
M. Thouvenel's arguments, but as the French Government
did not consider the question as now in existence, and promised
that it should not be revised without the consent of
Savoy, and consultation with the Great Powers, if the Government

it in the enclosed despatch. The more I reflect on it, the less
I think that I could pass over the Emperor's conduct and

offensive, and if I had let them pass unheeded might have
been repeated on another occasion. I must say that nothing
could have been more friendly than His Majesty's bearing

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My Lord</span>,&mdash;It is with extreme regret that I call your Lordship's
attention to the following occurrence.</p>

<p class="ind">There was a concert last night at the Tuileries, to which the Chiefs
of the Diplomatic Body were invited. On these occasions seats are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.391" id="pageiii.391"></a>[page&nbsp;391]</span>
assigned to the Ambassadors according to their accidental rank, and
I was placed between the Nuntio and the Russian Ambassador. It is
customary for the Emperor, during the interval between the two parts
of the concert, to say a few words to each of the Ambassadors individually,
and it is obvious that what His Majesty says to one may
easily be overheard by that one's immediate neighbours.</p>

<p class="ind">Yesterday evening the Emperor, after saying a few words of no
importance to the Nuntio, addressed himself to me in a manner and
tone very unusual with him, animadverting upon the hostile sentiments
evinced towards him in the English Parliament and Press.<a id="footnotetagXXIX12" name="footnotetagXXIX12"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIX12"><sup>12</sup></a>
"Wishing to avoid a discussion, I merely observed that I regretted
that matters should be in such a state, but that His Majesty must
be aware that there was quite as great irritation on this side the
water. The Emperor enquired sharply whether this was to be
wondered at, considering the terms and imputations applied to himself,
and to the French nation, in England? They were only defending
themselves against unfair attacks, His Majesty said. It was
really too bad, he continued; he had done all in his power to maintain
a good understanding with England, but the conduct of England
rendered it impossible. What had England to do with Savoy? And
why was she not to be satisfied with the declaration that His Majesty
had made to me, that he had no intention to annex Savoy to France
without having previously obtained the consent of the Great Powers.</p>
<span class="rightnote">LORD COWLEY'S REMONSTRANCE</span>
<p class="ind">"Pardon me, Sire," I said, "for interrupting your Majesty, but it
is just what you did not say. Had you permitted me to convey that
assurance to Her Majesty's Government, I will answer for it that all
those interpellations in Parliament would long since have ceased,
and that Her Majesty's Government and the country would at all
events have awaited the decision at which the Great Powers might
have arrived."</p>

<p class="ind">"But I told you," continued the Emperor, "that I would consult
the Great Powers."</p>

<p class="ind">"Yes, Sire," I replied, "but your Majesty did not add that you
would abide by their decision."</p>

<p class="ind">This conversation had taken place, not only within the hearing of
the Russian Ambassador, but the Emperor's remarks were addressed
almost as much to my colleague as to myself. Turning then entirely
towards General Kisseleff, the Emperor continued: "The conduct of
England is inexplicable. I have done all in my power to keep on the
best terms with her; but I am at my wits' end <i>(je n'en puis plus).</i>
What," His Majesty exclaimed again, "has England to do with
Savoy? What would have been the consequence if, when she took
possession of the Island of Perim<a id="footnotetagXXIX13" name="footnotetagXXIX13"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIX13"><sup>13</sup></a> for the safety of her Eastern dominions,
I had raised the same objections that she has now raised
to the annexation of Savoy, which I want as much for the safety of
France?"</p>

<p class="ind">His Majesty continued to speak for a few seconds in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.392" id="pageiii.392"></a>[page&nbsp;392]</span>
strain, and I felt my position to be most awkward. With the
remembrance of His Majesty's intemperate words to M. de H&uuml;bner
on New Year's Day, 1859,<a id="footnotetagXXIX14" name="footnotetagXXIX14"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIX14"><sup>14</sup></a> in my mind, I did not like to leave unnoticed
observations of the tendency I have mentioned. At the
same time I had to bear in mind that I was not present on an official
occasion, but that I was the Emperor's guest, and that it would not
be right to continue a discussion in the presence of others. These
thoughts passed rapidly through my mind, and I determined to be
guided by a night's reflection in taking any further step in this
matter. What that reflection might have produced I cannot say,
but circumstances led to more immediate explanations.</p>

<p class="ind">As the Emperor moved on, the circle in which we were standing
was not strictly kept, and after a few minutes I found myself standing
a little in front, in the open space round which the circle was formed.
The Emperor again accosted me, and was beginning in the same
strain, when I ventured to interrupt His Majesty and to tell him that
I considered myself justified in calling his attention to the unusual
course he had adopted, in indulging, in presence of the Russian Ambassador,
in his animadversions on the conduct of England. That
His Majesty, if he had, or thought he had, any cause for remonstrance
or blame with regard to England, should address himself to me, was
not only natural, but would be a course which I should always beg
him to take, because free discussion was the best remedy for pent-up
feeling. I should answer as best I could, and endeavour to convince
His Majesty when I thought him wrong. Or if His Majesty considered
it right to complain of the conduct of England to the Russian Ambassador,
I had no desire to interfere, provided it was not done in my
presence; but what I could not approve, or consider compatible with
my own dignity, or that of the Government which I represented, was
that complaints respecting England should be addressed to me in the
hearing of the Russian Ambassador, and to the Russian Ambassador
in my hearing.</p>

<p class="ind">Leaving then this official tone, I added that, considering the long
and intimate relations which His Majesty had been graciously pleased
to permit should exist between himself and me, and knowing, as he
did, the personal attachment which I bore him, and the anxiety which
I had ever manifested to smooth difficulties and prevent misunderstandings
between the two Governments, in doing which I had perhaps
exposed myself to the suspicion of being more French than I
ought to be, I had not expected to have been addressed, as I had been,
in the presence of the Russian Ambassador, or to have heard words
addressed to that Ambassador complaining of the sentiments of the
English nation.</p>

<p class="ind">The Emperor frequently interrupted me, expressing his great regret
at what had occurred. He could assure me, His Majesty said, that
he had spoken without any bad intention&mdash;that he had just read
what had occurred in Parliament the night before, and that he had
been greatly hurt at the strictures passed upon his conduct; I must
recollect further that he had not spoken of the Government, but of
those who attacked him. Again, His Majesty begged me to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.393" id="pageiii.393"></a>[page&nbsp;393]</span>
no more of the matter, repeating the assurance that he had spoken
without intention.</p>

<p class="ind">In the course of this second conversation the Emperor again asked,
but in a very different tone, why England had taken up the question
of Savoy which so little regarded her. Had it been Prussia or one of
the Continental Powers, His Majesty could have understood it, but
not a word of remonstrance had proceeded from any one of them.
I replied that I did not think the Emperor could rely on that silence
as indicating approbation, but at all events, I said, the position of Her
Majesty's Government was very different from that of the other
powers. How was it possible, I asked, for Her Majesty's Government
to remain silent in presence of the interpellations respecting Savoy
which were, night after night, put to them? And if His Majesty
enquired why these interpellations were put, I would answer him
that, if my judgment was correct, it was not so much on account of
the actual plan of annexing Savoy, as on account of the circumstances
connected with the whole transaction. They were, in fact, interpellations
of mistrust. And how, I asked, could it be otherwise?
What could the English people think on its transpiring that in spite
of His Majesty's declarations, both before and during the war, that
in going to war he meditated no special advantages for France,
overtures had positively been made months before, to Sardinia, for
the eventual cession of Savoy; why had not His Majesty told us
fairly, in commencing this war, that if, by the results of the war, the
territory of Sardinia should be greatly augmented, he might be
obliged, in deference to public opinion in France, to ask for some
territorial advantage? Such a declaration, although it might have
rendered the British Government still more anxious to prevent the
war, would have hindered all the manifestation of public opinion
which is now taking place.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR'S <i>AMENDE</i></span>
<p class="ind">The Emperor seemed to feel the weight of these observations, and
he ended the conversation by saying, that if this question of Savoy
should go further, he had pledged himself to consult the Great Powers,
and that he need hardly add that if their opinion should be unfavourable
to his wishes, it would have great weight with him. "It is not
likely," said His Majesty, "that I should act against the advice of
Europe."</p>

<p class="ind">I end, my Lord, as I commenced, in regretting this occurrence. I
could have wished that the Emperor had not spoken to me a second
time yesterday, and that I had had a little time for reflection. I feel
that I spoke to His Majesty under considerable emotion, caused by
the tone and manner which he had adopted; but I am certain that
not a word escaped me which was not respectful to himself. To have
passed the matter over, would, in my judgment, have been a fault,
but on the whole I should have preferred conveying impressions to
His Majesty through M. Thouvenel. I earnestly trust, however,
that Her Majesty's Government will view my conduct in a favourable
light.</p>

<p class="ind">It is but justice to my Russian colleague to state that nothing could
have been in better taste than his remarks in answer to the Emperor's
observations to him. I have told General Kisseleff this morning that
having had an opportunity to do so, I had expressed to the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.394" id="pageiii.394"></a>[page&nbsp;394]</span>
the opinion that it would have been better had His Majesty avoided
irritating topics concerning England in the presence of another
foreign representative. It is not my intention to open my lips on the
subject to any one else.</p>

<span class="rightnote">SWISS CLAIMS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>25th March 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has just seen the Swiss Note, and has returned it
to the Foreign Office.<sup>16</sup> With reference to Lord John Russell's
letter of this morning, she has only to express her anxiety that
her Government should not look upon this question as one of an
<i>optional</i> character to take up or not. We have no choice, and
the consideration whether what we are doing may be pleasing
or displeasing to France cannot be entertained for a moment,
although the Queen is grieved to find from Lord Cowley's last
letter that he considers the question from that point of view.
We are parties to a treaty of guarantee together with other
Powers, and have as such a clear and solemn <i>duty</i> to perform.
We should therefore openly and avowedly call upon our
partners in this treaty and guarantee to consider the note
addressed by the Swiss Confederation to us.</p>

<p class="ind">The proper course would be to summon the Ministers of the
Contracting Powers to the Foreign Office (not excluding the
French Ambassador), and to go with them into the matter.
This would take it out of the hands of the Emperor and M. de
Thouvenel, and make (the Queen is certain of it) a deep impression
upon them.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes this letter to be shown to Lord Palmerston
and Lord John's other colleagues.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 16: The Swiss Government claimed that the districts of Chablais and Faucigny (being
parts of Savoy which had been handed over to Sardinia by the Treaty of Vienna under a
guarantee for their neutrality) should be given to Switzerland for the protection of their
frontier. The French Emperor maintained that it was sufficient for him to guarantee
the neutrality of those districts. Speaking on the night of the 26th, Lord John Russell
said: "The powers of Europe, if they wish to maintain peace, must respect each other's
limits, and, above all, restore and not disturb that commercial confidence which is the
result of peace, which tends to peace, and which ultimately forms the happiness of
nations."

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter and
Memorandum.<sup>17</sup> In whatever Lord John might say in the
House of Commons, care should be taken not to give the
French a handle to make the other Powers believe that there
exists an understanding between them and us. It is by making
each of them believe in their turn that the others have agreed
with France that the Emperor paralyses their action. If he
will promise distinctly to give up the neutral territory to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.396" id="pageiii.396"></a>[page&nbsp;396]</span>
Switzerland, that would be an understanding which we might
well avow, but the Queen fears Count Persigny with all his
anxiety to smooth matters (as he says) will not be able to
give this assurance, and consequently if Lord John sent the
Commons home with a declaration that matters would be
<i>satisfactorily</i> settled, and the Emperor intends to keep the
neutral territory after all, it would unnecessarily make them
dupes once more, as the Government have from time to time
given assurances based on French promises, which were belied
by subsequent acts.</p>

<p class="ind">Is the Memorandum for the Queen to keep?</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He is sorry he cannot agree that there would be any moral
wrong in assisting to overthrow the Government of the King
of the Two Sicilies. The best writers on International Law
consider it a merit to overthrow a tyrannical government, and
there have been few governments so tyrannical as that of
Naples. Of course the King of Sardinia has no right to assist
the people of the Two Sicilies unless he was asked by them
to do so, as the Prince of Orange was asked by the best men in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.398" id="pageiii.398"></a>[page&nbsp;398]</span>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter, and
trusts he will see, upon further reflection, that the case before
us is not one in which the Revolution of 1688, and the advent
of William III. called to the Throne, can be appealed to as a
parallel. The draft warns the Government of Sardinia "<i>not
to seek for new acquisitions</i>," as the new "<i>Provinces</i> annexed
have hardly as yet been thoroughly amalgamated." Now,
no public writer nor the International Law will call it morally
right, that one state should abet revolution in another, not
with the disinterested object of defending a suffering people
against tyranny, but in order to extinguish that State and
make it "an acquisition" of its own. If William III. had
made England a Province of Holland, he would not have
received the applause Lord John quotes. The Queen trusts
that in appreciation of this distinction, he will introduce some
amendment in the sense indicated in her former letter.</p>

Gibson were desirous of finding some means of visiting their
displeasure upon the House of Lords, but it was shown to
them that the only measures which could be adopted were
far too violent for the occasion, and that the House of Commons
itself is powerless in the matter. When the Lords
do anything inconsistent with the asserted privileges of the
House of Commons, as, for instance, inserting a taxing Clause
in a Bill sent up to them, or making an alteration in a Money
Bill sent up to them, the House of Commons is necessarily
invited to do something afterwards in the matter, by assenting
to what has been done by the Lords; and the Commons
then assert their claimed rights by throwing out the Bill
thus, improperly, as the Commons say, meddled with by
the Lords; but when the Lords throw out a Bill there is
nothing for the Commons to do, as the Bill has vanished, and
the Commons are therefore furnished with no opportunity
of asserting the right which they may claim. But, moreover,
the Commons have always contended that the Lords cannot
originate or alter a Money Bill, but it has never been contended
that the Lords may not reject a Money Bill, though
there are few instances of their having done so. These arguments
at length prevailed, and by four o'clock it was agreed
that Viscount Palmerston should give notice that he would
on Thursday move that a Committee be appointed to examine<span class="rightnote">COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONS</span>
the Journals of the House of Lords to ascertain the fate of
the Bill thus lost like Sir John Franklin, and that on Friday
he should move the appointment of a Committee to search
for precedent applicable to the case. This course it was
thought, while binding the Government to no particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.402" id="pageiii.402"></a>[page&nbsp;402]</span>
course, would in some degree satisfy those who think some
step necessary. The measures mentioned, though it is fair
to say not actually proposed, were that Parliament should
be prorogued, and reassembled either in the Autumn or
Winter, that then the same Bill should be brought in, and
be sent up to the Lords, and that if that Bill were again
rejected, Parliament should be dissolved. It was objected to
all this, that the case did not warrant such a course; that
whether the Lords have or have not overstepped their proper
functions, the opinion of the great majority of the public is
that the Lords have done a right and useful thing (in confirmation
of which it may be stated that the people in the
gallery of the House of Lords are said to have joined in the
cheers which broke out when the numbers of the division
were announced).</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston, at the meeting of the House, gave
notice accordingly that he should on Thursday move for a
Committee to search the Lords' Journals&mdash;a usual form of
motion; and that he should on Friday move to appoint a
Committee to search for precedents in order to ascertain
facts; but he added that he did not take this course with
any view of hostility towards the House of Lords. An
attempt was made by Mr Whalley and Mr Digby Seymour
to set up a complaint that this was not the sort of proceeding
which the gravity of the occasion required, but this endeavour
was put down by an unmistakable manifestation of a contrary
opinion by the rest of the House....</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">House of Commons</span>, <i>2nd July 1860</i>.</p>
<p class="rindent">(8.30 P.M.)</p>


<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston has had the honour of receiving your
Majesty's letter of this afternoon. Nothing of much importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.403" id="pageiii.403"></a>[page&nbsp;403]</span>
as to Foreign Affairs was done at the Cabinet to-day.... The
material question for discussion was the course to be
pursued about the Tax Bill Report. Lord John Russell had
altered his opinion since Saturday, and had yesterday sent
Viscount Palmerston a Draft of Resolution which he wished
to be circulated to the members of the Cabinet before their
meeting at twelve to-day....</p>

<p class="ind">After a long discussion, the draft, of which the enclosed
is a copy, was agreed to by all except Mr Gladstone. This
draft is a combination of parts of Lord John's, parts of Sir
James Graham's, and parts of Viscount Palmerston's. No
mention of course was made in Cabinet of Sir James Graham
having made any suggestion.</p>

<p class="ind">When all the other members had left the room Mr
Gladstone requested Viscount Palmerston to submit to
your Majesty that he could no longer continue to carry
on the business of his Department.<sup>26</sup> His opinion strongly
was that action and not a Resolution was required, that
one of three courses ought to be pursued: either that
the Paper Duty Repeal Bill should again be sent up to
the Lords; or that a Bill should be sent up for suspending
the Paper Duties for a year; or that a Bill
should be sent up reducing those duties gradually year
by year; or fourthly that with the Repeal of the Paper
Duties should be coupled the imposition of Spirit Duties.
Viscount Palmerston said he really could not undertake the
communication which Mr Gladstone wished to be submitted
to your Majesty, and earnestly entreated Mr Gladstone to
reconsider the matter; he urged in detail all the reasons
which ought to dissuade such a step, and he thought that
he had produced some impression on Mr Gladstone. It was
agreed between them that Viscount Palmerston, instead of
giving notice this afternoon of a Motion to-morrow, and laying
the Resolution on the table this evening, should give notice
this afternoon of a Motion for Thursday, and promise to lay
the Resolution on the table to-morrow. This gives Mr Gladstone
more time to think, and more room to turn round in.
Mr Milner Gibson has no intention of going out, and has so
told Mr Gladstone, strongly advising him to stay in; and
Viscount Palmerston's impression is that Mr Gladstone, having
failed to become master of the Cabinet by a threat of resignation,
will in the end yield to the almost unanimous decision
of his colleagues. The only person who supported
Mr Gladstone's views, except Mr Milner Gibson, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.404" id="pageiii.404"></a>[page&nbsp;404]</span>
Duke of Argyll, who, however, like Mr Gibson, had no intention
whatever of accompanying Mr Gladstone in resignation.<sup>27</sup>...</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 26: This is said to have been an incident of frequent occurrence during the second
administration of Lord Palmerston.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 27: The Queen wrote to King Leopold: "As I told you in my little note of Sunday, Lord
John became <i>quite</i> reasonable, and is very moderate about this affair; on the other hand
Mr Gladstone has threatened to resign&mdash;and it is still uncertain if he will not persist in
his intention. He is terribly excited."

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>6th July 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that the House of Commons this
night passed the three Privilege Resolutions after two
divisions.<sup>28</sup>...</p>

<p class="ind">The Debate which did not begin till half-past eight, after
questions on the adjournment to Monday, was commenced
by Mr Digby Seymour, Member for Southampton, who went
into an elaborate discussion of the precedents mentioned in
the appendix to the Report of the Committee, arguing against
the right of the Lords. He attacked Viscount Palmerston's
speech, and highly praised that of Mr Gladstone, who, he
said, if he lost his place in the Cabinet in consequence of
that speech would be rewarded by a Throne in the affections
of the Nation. Mr Horsman then made a very able, eloquent,
and remarkable speech, well worth reading....</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Bright made an indignation speech in reply. He went
over the same ground as the former speaker about the precedents,
was astonished and shocked at Mr Horsman's speech,
was displeased with the Resolutions, and with Viscount Palmerston's
speech, was in admiration unbounded of Mr Gladstone,
but all the time was so hoarse that his efforts to make
himself heard gave to his utterance an appearance of passion
even greater than that which he actually felt. After his
speech the House began skirmishing as to the question of
finishing the Debate or adjourning it, but the Resolutions
were at last agreed to.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 28: The Resolutions, which the Committee recommended, and the House of Commons
adopted, declared <i>inter alia</i> that the Commons had in their own hands the power "so
to impose and remit taxes, and frame bills of supply, that their rights as to the matter,
manner, measure, and time might be maintained inviolate."

Crimean War, and the expressed desire of the Canadians to be visited by the Queen in

Prince of Wales should make a tour there. During the course of the visit, which was
made in company with the Duke of Newcastle, the Prince opened the magnificent bridge
over the St Lawrence; he subsequently availed himself of President Buchanan's invitation
already referred to (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#pageiii.373" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 373</a>), and was received with the greatest enthusiasm at
Washington. The Prince returned to England in November.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and submits the accompanying letters which he has
received from Lord John Russell, together with Lord John's
letter to him; and he certainly agrees with Lord John in
thinking that a meeting at present between your Majesty
and the Emperor of Austria, though in many respects likely
to be useful, would on the whole be so liable to misconstruction,
and would prove such a fertile source of misrepresentation,
that it would be better to avoid it. Such a meeting would
undoubtedly be useful to the Emperor of Austria, by reason
of the good advice which he would receive from your Majesty,
and from His Royal Highness the Prince Consort; but your
Majesty will probably be able to find some other way of conveying
to the Emperor counsel calculated to save him from

respecting the hint thrown out by Count Rechberg<sup>37</sup> of a

with Lord Palmerston, that while such an interview might
for many reasons have been desirable, under present circumstances
it might lead to much talk and to many rumours
which might do harm, or at any rate give rise to useless conjectures.
It would therefore be better to "nip this project
in the bud" as Lord John suggests, but care should be taken
to do this in such a manner as not to let it appear that there
was any disinclination on the Queen's part to meet the
Emperor of Austria.</p>

<p class="ind">The way in which the English Press misunderstands all
these things is quite lamentable. The meeting of the Sovereigns
had this time a better object than the oppression of
the liberties of Nations; that this should not be seen by
people who would be the first sufferers of the supremacy
of a certain power is very lamentable, but they see everything
only according to the colour of <i>their</i> spectacles. <i>Le Flibustive</i>

King has been so calumniated that Garibaldi is the rage of
the present moment; Colonel Walker<sup>40</sup> has been shot, and

course of the summer visited South Africa. After making a tour through Kaffraria,
Natal, and the Orange Free State, he returned to Cape Town, where, in September, he
laid the foundation stone of the breakwater in Table Bay. In a letter written by the
Prince Consort a few weeks earlier to Baron Stockmar, he remarks upon the noteworthy
coincidence that almost in the same week in which the elder brother would open the great
bridge across the St Lawrence, the younger would lay the foundation stone of the breakwater
for the Cape Town Harbour. "What a cheering picture is here," he wrote, "of
the progress and expansion of the British race, and of the useful co-operation of the
Royal Family in the civilisation which England has developed and advanced" (<i>Life of
the Prince Consort</i>, vol. v. p. 88).</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>3rd November 1860.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the enclosed draft,<sup>41</sup> which she is afraid
is not likely to produce the beneficial results which Lord John
seems to anticipate.</p>

<p class="ind">The expression of our hope, that Rome and Venetia, from
their Italian nationality, will soon share in the freedom and
good government of the rest of Italy, can only be understood
as a declaration on our part that we wish to see them share
the annexation to Sardinia, after that of the Two Sicilies shall
have been completed.</p>

<p class="ind">The declaration at the end after the quotations of the
former protests, vague as it is, viz. "That if other Powers
interfere England would do as she pleases," means either
nothing at all (for England is free to do as she pleases) or it
means a threat of war, either an empty threat, or one intended
to be followed up when the occasion arises. The first
would hardly be dignified for a great Power like England,
and as to the second, the Queen for one is not prepared to
decide to go to war to ensure the success of the Italian Revolution.</p>

<p class="ind">But is such a declaration at the present moment called
for by anything that has happened? Another despatch has
accepted as satisfactory the French explanation about the
order given to the fleet before Ga&euml;ta, and Austria has renewed
her assurances that she will not interfere; the only
Power likely to continue to interfere and to produce war&mdash;Sardinia&mdash;is
held to have an exceptional right to it, as an
"Italian" Power.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thinks this important despatch should not be
laid before her again without its having received the deliberate
consideration and assent of the whole Cabinet, and in case
Lord John should bring it before them the Queen would wish
him to communicate this letter also to them, as embodying
her views on the subject.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 41: This draft despatch, prepared in order to be sent to all the Powers, expressed approval
of the Italian Revolution. It concluded: "Her Majesty's Government deem it right
to declare that if any other Power should attempt forcible interference, Her Majesty's
Government will hold themselves free to act in such a manner as the rights of nations,
the independence of Italy, and the interests of Europe may seem to them to require."

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to submit that, as it appears from a despatch
from Lord Cowley that the commercial negotiations at Paris
have been brought to a conclusion, and that Mr Cobden has
left Paris, the time has come for your Majesty to consider
what substantial mark of your Majesty's approval your

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>22nd November 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Victoria</span>,&mdash;I have to thank you for a most
kind letter of the 20th. I hope you will see the young and
very nice Empress of Austria,<sup>45</sup> perhaps you made a little
excursion to Plymouth. I had, and have still, some cold,
and therefore I was apprehensive of waiting at the station
on the 20th in the evening; I sent Marie and Philip to receive
the Empress. Yesterday before daybreak I went myself to
Antwerp. I first paid the Empress a visit, and then I took
her to your beautiful ship. She was much struck with it,
and it was <i>very kind</i> of you, and indeed, for an invalid, invaluable.
It will show, besides, that even beyond Garibaldi,
and that amiable, disinterested <i>Annex</i>ander, you can feel
some interest. I saw the Empress already dressed for her
departure, but I think there is something very peculiar about
her, which is very pleasing. Poor soul, to see her go away
under, I fear, not very safe circumstances, as she coughs a
great deal, quite grieves one; though it certainly increased
my stupid cold, still I should have been sorry not to have
assisted at her going to sea. It was a beautiful day, but this
night it has begun to blow from the West-south-west, which
I fear will create a sea to the Westward.</p>

<p class="ind">That you had your sons about you must have been a great
satisfaction to you. Bertie got well through his truly tremendous
tour. I think that the effect on the Americans will
last for some time. That the poor Duke of Newcastle got
home without accident is surprising. Affy has something most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.415" id="pageiii.415"></a>[page&nbsp;415]</span>
winning, and is a dear little rogue. Eug&eacute;nie's expedition<sup>46</sup>
is most astonishing. She also coughs much, and I never
heard Scotland recommended for Winter excursions. I
believe that the death of her sister affected her a good deal.
She seems to have been a good deal <i>choqu&eacute;e</i> that she had been
dancing in Africa when that poor sister was dying. Next to
this, there seems a difference of opinion with her master on
the subject of the Pope. You will recollect that at the time
of his elections the clergy rendered him undoubted good
service; I even doubt that he would have been elected without
their aid. Now he puts the axe to the root of the whole
Catholic Church by destroying the Pope, and he does this
<i>without the slightest provocation</i>, and for the benefit of the
revolution <i>et des r&eacute;volutionnaires</i>....</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE SEE OF WORCESTER</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>1st December 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Palmerston's second letter
respecting the Bishopric of Worcester,<sup>48</sup> just as she was going
to answer the first. While not objecting to the nomination
of Mr Bayley,<sup>49</sup> she wanted to point out the importance of, at a
future vacancy, not to confine the selection to respectable
parish priests, but to bear in mind that the Bench of Bishops
should not be left devoid of some University men of acknowledged
standing and theological learning; it would be seriously
weakened if, in controversies on points of doctrine agitating
the Church, no value were attached to the opinions at least
of some of those who are to govern her. Lord Palmerston
may now have an opportunity of selecting a stronger man
of Liberal views from Cambridge.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 48: Bishop Henry Pepys had died in November, and was succeeded in the following
January by Canon Henry Philpott of Norwich, Master of St Catharine's College, Cambridge.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 49: Probably the Rev. Emilius Bayley, Rector of St George's, Bloomsbury; now the
Rev. Sir Emilius Laurie.
</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">EPISCOPAL APPOINTMENTS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>2nd December 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and very sincerely congratulates your Majesty upon
the arrangement of a marriage which bids so fair to secure for
Her Royal Highness the Princess Alice that happiness to
which her amiable and estimable qualities so justly entitle her.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to bishops, Viscount Palmerston would beg
to submit that the bishops are in the Church what generals
of districts are in the Army: their chief duties consist in
watching over the clergy of their diocese, seeing that they
perform properly their parochial duties, and preserving
harmony between the clergy and the laity, and softening the
asperities between the Established Church and the Dissenters.
For these purposes it is desirable that a bishop should have
practical knowledge of parochial functions, and should not be
of an overbearing and intolerant temperament. His diocesan
duties are enough to occupy all his time, and the less he engages
in theological disputes the better. Much mischief has
been done by theological bishops, and if the Bench were filled
with men like the Bishops of Oxford and Exeter there would
be no religious peace in the land. Nor have men chosen
merely for their learning succeeded better; Thirlwall, Bishop
of St David's, and Blomfield, the late Bishop of London, were
chosen on account of their learning; the former is acknowledged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.417" id="pageiii.417"></a>[page&nbsp;417]</span>
to be inefficient, the latter greatly mismanaged his
diocese. The theological learning of the Bishop of Exeter<sup>50</sup>
has caused much mischief to the Established Church. Viscount
Palmerston would also beg to submit that the intolerant
maxims of the High Church bishops have exasperated the
Dissenters who form a large portion of the nation, and have
given offence to many good Churchmen. The Bishop of
Exeter, the late Bishop of Carlisle,<sup>51</sup> and the late Bishop of
Rochester,<sup>52</sup> the two latter individuals kind-hearted and good-natured
men, refused to consecrate burial grounds unless a
wall of separation divided the portion allotted to Churchmen
from the portion allotted to Dissenters&mdash;a demand which gave
offence to both communities. Viscount Palmerston would
beg to submit that several of the bishops whom he has had
the honour of recommending to your Majesty had distinguished
themselves by their classical and academical attainments,
and he may mention in this respect the names of Baring,
Longley, Tait, Wigram, and Waldegrave. Viscount Palmerston
can assure your Majesty that although his selection of
bishops has been much found fault with by the High Church,
Puseyite, and semi-Catholic Party, they have given great
satisfaction to the nation at large, and Viscount Palmerston
has received communications to that effect, verbal and written,
from persons of all classes, and political parties in all parts
of the country. The people of this country are essentially
Protestant, they feel the deepest aversion to Catholicism, and
they see that the High Church, Tractarian, and Puseyite
doctrines lead men to the Church of Rome. The disgraceful
scenes last year at St George's in the East<sup>53</sup> were only an
exaggerated outburst of a very general and deeply-rooted
feeling. Viscount Palmerston believes that the clergy of the
Established Church were never more exemplary in the performance
of their duties, more respected by the Laity and,
generally speaking, on better terms with the Nonconformist
body than at the present time.</p>

mine now. We expect the Empress at half-past one, and I
will certainly give her your message. She is very amiable,
and one must like her. There seems to be no doubt that
there were many scenes, partly about the Pope, and also on
account of her sister's funeral; she was so angry with Fould
about it that she insisted on his dismissal.<a id="footnotetagXXIX54" name="footnotetagXXIX54"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIX54"><sup>54</sup></a> Then the Priests
are said to try and work upon her, and say that her son will
die if the Emperor continues <i>dans cette voie</i> against the Pope.</p>

<p class="ind">We saw Mr Elliot<a id="footnotetagXXIX55" name="footnotetagXXIX55"></a><a href="#footnoteXXIX55"><sup>55</sup></a> from Naples yesterday, who has always
been very fair. He says that <i>if</i>, when the King came to the
Throne, he had <i>only</i> insisted on the laws of the country being
properly carried out, <i>no</i> reforms or change in the Constitution
would have been necessary&mdash;but from the want of energy,
and also no strength of intellect and great indecision of character
of the poor King, as well as an unfortunate <i>Piet&auml;t</i> for the
memory of his father, nothing right was done; bad counsellors
surrounded him, the Queen Mother had a bad influence, and
finally everything was given up as lost&mdash;when it might yet
have been prevented. They dislike extremely being annexed,
but prefer it to having back the former state of things.</p>

<p class="ind">We have since ten or twelve days almost incessant rain, so
that we shall soon be on an island. This is the more distressing
as we can't go to Osborne at present&mdash;there being a sort of
epidemic fever which the doctors declare is in the air and that
it would be running too great a risk if we went. But we have
perpetual sunshine in the house when we look at our dear
young lovers, who are <i>so</i> happy, so devoted to each other,
that it does one good to see it; he is so modest and unassuming
that we feel as if he was one of our own children; and he is <i>so</i>
good and amiable, has such an open honest character, such a
warm heart, such high principles, and is withal so merry and
<i>aufgeweckt</i> that I feel we have <i>gained</i> a son and shall <i>not</i>
lose
a daughter&mdash;for we shall be able to have them a good deal
with us, Louis not having any duties to detain him much at
home at present. I can't say what happiness and comfort it
is to me. I feel my dear child will first of all have a peaceful,
quiet, happy home, without difficulties&mdash;and secondly, that
she will not be entirely cut off from us and monopolised as
our poor Vicky is.</p>

<p class="ind">I add a few lines since we have seen the Empress. She
came at half-past one, and stayed till a little after three. She
looked very pretty, but very sad&mdash;and in speaking of her
health and of her return from Algiers began to cry. She
seems to be much better, however, for her journey; before
she could neither eat nor sleep, nor would she take notice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.419" id="pageiii.419"></a>[page&nbsp;419]</span>
anything. She never mentioned the Emperor but once when
she offered his compliments, and there was not the slightest
allusion to politics. It is altogether very strange. She
remains another week in England, and then goes back as she
came. I gave her your message, and she enquired after you.

<p class="indright"><i>Windsor Castle, 11th December 1860</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;I have to thank you for two <i>most</i>
kind letters of the 4th and 7th. Your kind interest in our
dear child's happiness&mdash;your approval of this marriage of our
dear Alice, which, I cannot deny, has been for <i>long</i> an ardent
wish of mine, and just therefore I feared <i>so</i> much it <i>never</i> would
come to pass, gives us the greatest pleasure. <i>Now</i>&mdash;that <i>all</i>
has been so <i>happily</i> settled, and that I find the young man so
very charming&mdash;my joy, and my <i>deep</i> gratitude to God are
very great! He is so loveable, so very <i>young</i>, and like one of
our own children&mdash;not the <i>least in the way</i>&mdash;but a dear,
pleasant, <i>bright</i> companion, full of fun and spirits, and I am
<i>sure</i> will be a <i>great</i> comfort to us, besides being an excellent
husband to our dear, good Alice, who, though radiant with
joy and much in love (which well she may be), is as quiet and
sensible as possible.</p>

<p class="ind">The Empress is still here, and enjoys her liberty of <i>all</i>
things. We went to town for the Smithfield Cattle Show
yesterday, and visited her at Claridge's Hotel. She very
civilly wanted us to avoid the trouble, but we felt that it
would not be civil if we did not, and that hereafter even the
French might say that she had not been treated with due
respect. She looked very pretty, and was in very good spirits,
but again carefully avoided any allusion to her husband and
to politics, though she talked a great deal about all she was
seeing!...</p>

<p class="ind">I must now wish you good-bye. Ever your devoted Niece,</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XXX</h3>


<p>Early in 1861&mdash;a year destined to close in sorrow and desolation&mdash;
Queen Victoria experienced a heavy grief in the death of her mother,
the Duchess of Kent, at the age of seventy-four.</p>

<p>In January, fresh overtures were made to Lord Palmerston by the
Conservative leaders, with a view of supporting him in office against
the dissentients in his Ministry, especially Lord John Russell and
Mr Gladstone, whose views on the questions of Reform and National
Defence respectively were opposed to those of the Premier. Lord
Palmerston was indifferent to the support of Mr Gladstone; but a
unity of view on the Italian policy of the Government held the three
Liberal statesmen together.</p>

<p>The attack on the Paper Duties was repeated by Mr Gladstone,
who, on this occasion, combined all his fiscal proposals in a single
Bill. The measure, after strong opposition, passed the Commons
by a majority of fifteen, and the Peers subsequently accepted the
Budget, which took a penny off the income tax, while maintaining
the existing tea and sugar Duties. In July, Lord John Russell,
who had entered Parliament in 1813, before he came of age and
had been leader of the House of Commons at the time of the Queen's
accession, was transferred to the House of Lords. In August, the
Queen and the Prince Consort, with the Prince of Wales and Prince
Alfred, paid a third visit to Ireland.</p>

<p>The affairs of Italy still continued to attract public attention. At
the end of 1860, the French fleet had been despatched to Ga&euml;ta to
protect the interests of King Francis; this protection, given in
violation of the principle of non-intervention, was withdrawn in
January, and the garrison surrendered to the Piedmontese Admiral.
On the 18th of February, the new Parliament of Italy met at Turin,
the debates emphasising the vital necessity of including both Rome
and Venetia in a united nation; Victor Emmanuel was declared
King of Italy, a title promptly recognised by Great Britain; but in
June, to the profound grief of the Italian nation, Cavour, its Prime
Minister, and the mainspring of the Piedmontese policy, died while
still in the prime of life.</p>

<p>King Frederick William of Prussia had died in January, and was
succeeded by his brother, William I., Prince of Prussia, who was
crowned with Queen Augusta, at K&ouml;nigsberg, on the 18th of October,
Lord Clarendon attending as British representative. In the following
month, King Pedro of Portugal, son and successor of Donna
Maria, and his brother Ferdinand, died of typhoid fever; another
brother, Prince John, succumbed to the same malady before the close
of the year.</p>

<p>Events of great importance took place in North America, where
the secession of South Carolina was followed by that of other Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.421" id="pageiii.421"></a>[page&nbsp;421]</span>
States. The delegates of the latter assembled in February at Montgomery,
Alabama, and nominated Jefferson Davis as their President,
Abraham Lincoln having been previously elected as the new President
of the United States. The first shot had been fired, on the 9th of
January, in Charleston Harbour, where a Secessionist battery opened
its guns on a vessel sent by the Federal Government to reinforce
Fort Sumter. In April, the Confederate troops attacked the Fort,
which was compelled to surrender, whereupon President Lincoln
issued a proclamation calling for 75,000 volunteers; President Davis
replied by issuing (in default of an official fleet) letters of marque
to privately owned vessels, and Lincoln declared the Southern ports
in a state of blockade. In May, Lord John Russell announced that
the British Government would recognise the South as a belligerent
power, and a proclamation of neutrality was issued. At Bull Run,
on the 21st of July, the Federals were defeated, and fled in confusion
to Washington. Hostilities continued during the year, and Great
Britain was nearly involved in war, by the seizure, on the 8th of
November, by the captain of a Federal vessel, the <i>San Jacinto</i>, of
Messrs Slidell and Mason, the envoys accredited by the Confederate
States to Great Britain and France. This high-handed action was
taken while the envoys in question were passengers to Europe, by
the British mail steamer <i>Trent</i>, between Havana and St Thomas, and
the public mind of Great Britain was greatly excited in consequence;
but eventually the envoys were transferred to a British ship-of-war,
and arrived in Great Britain, not, however, until in view of a threatened
aggression on British North America, troops had been despatched
from England to strengthen the Canadian garrisons on the
frontier. The despatch of Lord Russell to the American Government,
which led to a pacific result, had been revised by Prince Albert, in the
direction of leaving open to that Government an honourable retreat
from the aggressive attitude they had taken up; the Prince's action
in this respect, the beneficial effect of which it would be difficult to
exaggerate, was destined to be the last of a long series of political
services rendered to this country.</p>

<p>It had become apparent in the autumn that Prince Albert's normal
health was impaired, and in November he began to suffer from persistent
insomnia; towards the end of the month the fever originated
which was to prove fatal to him. He suffered at first from rheumatic
pains and constant weakness, until, early in December, what was
thought to be influenza developed, and the Prince was confined to
his room. By the 11th his condition, though not hopeless, had
become grave, and the serious nature of the illness was made public;
and, although on the 12th the Queen could write hopefully to King
Leopold, the malady continued to increase. On the evening of the
13th, a rally took place, and encouraging reports were brought hourly
to the Queen through the night; but congestion of the lungs supervened
on the following day, in the closing hours of which, to the
inexpressible grief both of the Queen and her subjects, the Prince
passed peacefully away. The letters of the Queen to King Leopold
and Lord Canning express, in language to which nothing can be added,
the intensity of her grief, and, no less, the noble and unselfish courage
with which she resolved to devote her life to her children and country.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">CONSERVATIVE OVERTURES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Broadlands</span>, <i>1st January 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Viscount Palmerston</span> presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to be allowed to wish your Majesty and
His Royal Highness the Prince Consort many prosperous
returns of New Year's Day, with increasing happiness to your
Majesty and the Royal Family, and progressive advantage
to the Nation who have the good fortune to have your Majesty
for their Sovereign; and to adopt the language of Pope, he
would say,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"May day improve on day, and year on year,</p>
<p>Without a pain, a trouble, or a fear."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind">This Autumn and Winter, however, have been productive of
events in three of the four quarters of the Globe, which future
years are not likely to repeat. The capture of Pekin in Asia
by British and French troops; the Union in Europe of nearly
the whole of Italy into one Monarchy; and the approaching
and virtually accomplished Dissolution in America of the
great Northern Confederation, are events full of importance
for the future, as well as being remarkable in time present.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston submits two letters which your
Majesty may feel an interest in seeing. With regard to that
from Lord John Russell stating a half-formed wish to go to
the House of Lords, Viscount Palmerston does not expect
that the desire will be repeated when the Session begins,
although Lord John said last year that he felt attendance in
the House of Commons in addition to the labour of his office,
more than he could well get through. He would be a loss to
Viscount Palmerston in the House of Commons, especially
after the removal of Mr Sidney Herbert to the House of Lords;<sup>1</sup>
and speaking confidentially to your Majesty with regard to
the future, Viscount Palmerston would think himself doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.423" id="pageiii.423"></a>[page&nbsp;423]</span>
better service by recommending the House of Lords for Mr
Gladstone, than for Lord John Russell.</p>

<p class="ind">Mr Herbert will take the title of Lord Herbert of Lea, the
title of Herbert being that borne by his elder brother during
the life of the late Lord Pembroke.</p>

<p class="ind">The other letter from Lord Malmesbury relates to a communication
which he made to Viscount Palmerston last year
from Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli at the beginning of the
Session, to the effect that, if the Government were then to
break up from internal dissensions, the Conservative Party
would support during the then ensuing Session any administration
which Viscount Palmerston might be able provisionally
to make, to carry through the business of the Session.<sup>2</sup> Viscount
Palmerston is not aware of any circumstances which can
have led to the expectation that the present administration is
likely to be broken up by internal divisions in the course of this
next Session. There are no questions ahead so likely to
produce discord as the Reform Bill of last year, and the
differences between the two Houses about the Paper Duties,
about which it was very difficult to prevent Lord John and
Mr Gladstone from flying off, or the Fortification Question,
upon which Mr Gladstone announced to his colleagues, nearly
a dozen times, that he was firmly resolved to resign. Viscount
Palmerston has asked Lord Malmesbury to come over to him
to Broadlands at any time before the 21st or 22nd of this
month, which is the probable time at which the Cabinet will
have to meet in London.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston finds he has not got Lord John
Russell's letter at hand, but the only thing of any interest in
it was the intimation which Viscount Palmerston quoted.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 1: Mr Herbert had been latterly in bad health, and resigned office in the summer. He
died on the 2nd of August.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 2: In his memoirs, Lord Malmesbury describes an interview with Lord and Lady
Palmerston on the 1st of June 1860, apparently the one at which this communication
was made. "It is evident," he writes, "he [Lord Palmerston] does not wish to lose
Lord John, though he would be very glad if Gladstone resigned."

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Princess Royal to Queen Victoria and the Prince Albert.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">DEATH OF KING OF PRUSSIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Potsdam</span>, <i>2nd January 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Beloved Parents</span>,&mdash;At last I can find a moment for myself
to sit down and collect my thoughts and to write to you an
account of these two last dreadful days! My head is in such
a state, I do not know where I am hardly&mdash;whether I am in
a dream or awake, what is yesterday and what to-day!
What we have so long expected is come at last! All the
confusion, bustle, excitement, noise, etc., is all swallowed up
in that one thought for me&mdash;I have seen death for the first
time! It has made an impression upon me that I shall never,
never forget as long as I live&mdash;and I feel so ill, so confused and
upset by all that I have gone through in the last forty-eight
hours, that you must forgive me if I write incoherently and
unclearly. But to go back to Monday evening (it seems to
me a year now). At a quarter to eight in the evening of Monday
the 31st, I took dear darling Affie to the railway station,
and took leave of him with a heavy heart. You know I love
that dear boy distractedly, and that nothing could have
given me more pleasure than his dear, long-wished-for visit.
At nine o'clock Fritz and I went to tea at the Prince Regent's;
we four were alone together. The Princess was rather low
and unwell, the Prince low-spirited, and I thinking of nothing
but Affie and of how dear he is. While we were sitting at
tea we received bad news from Sans Souci,<a id="footnotetagXXX3" name="footnotetagXXX3"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX3"><sup>3</sup></a> but nothing to
make us particularly uneasy. Fritz and I went home and to
bed, not being in a humour to sit up till twelve.</p>

<p class="ind">About half-past one we heard a knock at the door and my
wardrobe maid brought in a telegram saying the King was
given up, and a note from the Prince Regent saying he was
going up immediately. We got up in the greatest hurry and
dressed&mdash;I hardly know how; I put on just what I found,
and had not time to do my hair or anything. After we had
hurried on our clothes we went downstairs and out&mdash;for
there was no time to get a carriage or a footman or anything&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.425" id="pageiii.425"></a>[page&nbsp;425]</span>
was a splendid night, but twelve degrees of cold (R&eacute;aumur).
I thought I was in a dream finding myself alone in the street
with Fritz at two o'clock at night. We went to the Prince
Regent's, and then with them in their carriages to the railway
station&mdash;we four all alone in the train. We arrived at Sans
Souci and went directly into the room where the King lay&mdash;the
stillness of death was in the room&mdash;only the light of the
fire and of a dim lamp. We approached the bed and stood
there at the foot of it, not daring to look at one another or to
say a word. The Queen was sitting in an armchair at the
head of the bed, her arm underneath the King's head, and her
head on the same pillow on which he lay; with her other
hand she continually wiped the perspiration from his forehead.
You might have heard a pin drop; no sound was heard but
the crackling of the fire and the <i>death-rattle</i>, that dreadful
sound which goes to one's heart, and which tells plainly that
life is ebbing. This rattling in the throat lasted about an
hour longer, and then the King lay motionless. The doctors
bent their heads low to hear whether he still breathed&mdash;and
we stood, not even daring to sit down, watching the death-struggle;
every now and then the King breathed very fast
and loud, but never unclosed his eyes; he was very red in
the face, and the cold perspiration pouring from his forehead.
I never spent such an awful time! And to see the poor
Queen sitting there quite rent my heart&mdash;three, four, five,
six, seven struck, and we were still standing there&mdash;one
member of the family came in after the other and remained
motionless in the room, sobs only breaking the silence. Oh!
it is dreadful to see a person die! All the thoughts and feelings
that crowded on my mind in those hours I cannot describe,
more than in my whole past lifetime. The light of the morning
dawned, and the lamps were taken away&mdash;oh, how sad for
the first morning in the year! We all went into the next
room, for I assure you, anxiety, watching, standing, and
crying had worn us out. The Princess fell asleep on a
chair, I on a sofa, and the rest walked up and down the room
asking one another, How long will it last? Towards the
middle of the day, Marianne and I went into the room alone,
as we wished to stay there; we came up and kissed the Queen's
hand and knelt down and kissed the King's; it was quite
warm still. We stood about and waited till five o'clock and
then had some dinner, and I felt so sick and faint and unwell,
that Fritz sent me here to bed. At one o'clock this morning
I got up and dressed, and heard that the King had not many
minutes more to live, but by the time I had got the carriage I
heard all was over. I drove to Sans Souci and saw the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.426" id="pageiii.426"></a>[page&nbsp;426]</span>
and Queen. May God bless and preserve them, and may
theirs be a long and happy and blessed reign. Then I went
into the room where the King lay, and I could hardly bring
myself to go away again. There was so much of comfort in
looking at that quiet, peaceful form, at rest at last after all
he had suffered&mdash;gone home at last from this world of suffering&mdash;so
peaceful and quiet he looked, like a sleeping child. Every
moment I expected to see him move or breathe&mdash;his mouth
and eyes closed, and such a sweet and happy expression&mdash;both
his hands were on the coverlid. I kissed them both for
the last time; they were quite cold then. Fritz and I stood
looking at him for some time. I could hardly bring myself
to believe that this was really death, that which I had so often
shuddered at and felt afraid of; there was nothing there
dreadful or appalling, only a heavenly calm and peace. I felt
it did me so much good, and was such a comfort. "Death,
where is thy sting? Grave, where is thy victory?" He
was a just and good man, and had a heart overflowing with
love and kindness, and he has gone to his rest after a long
trial which he bore with so much patience. I am not afraid
of death now, and when I feel inclined to be so, I shall think
of that solemn and comforting sight, and that death is only a
change for the better. We went home and to bed and this
morning went there at ten. I sat some time with the poor
Queen, who is so calm and resigned and touching in her grief.
She does not cry, but she looks heartbroken. She said to
me: "I am not longer of any use in this world. I have no
longer any vocation, any duties to perform. I only lived
for him." Then she was so kind to me, kinder than she has
ever been yet, and said I was like her own child and a comfort
to her. I saw the corpse again this morning; he is unaltered,
only changed in colour, and the hands are stiffened.</p>

<p class="ind">The funeral will be on Saturday; the King will lie in state
till then. His wish was to be buried in Friedenskirche before
the altar&mdash;and his heart at Charlottenburg in the Mausoleum.
Of course all will be done that he wishes. His servants are
in a dreadful state. They adored him, and nursed him day
and night for three years with the most devoted attachment.
The King and Queen stay at Sans Souci till after the funeral,
and Fritz and I here at Potsdam.... Ever your most dutiful
and devoted Daughter,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Victoria</span>.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The funeral will only take place on Monday, and
the body will be embalmed to-morrow. To-morrow evening
there will be prayers at the bedside, and the day after the
lying in state.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">ITALIAN AFFAIRS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Broadlands</span>, <i>10th January 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and has many apologies to make for not having
sooner answered your Majesty's previous communications.
He is glad to be able to say that Lady Jocelyn's youngest boy,
whose illness has been the cause of very great anxiety, is now
in the course of gradual, but favourable recovery.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston returns to your Majesty the letter
of the Emperor of the French, and your Majesty's excellent
answer; it is to be hoped that he will profit by the sound
advice which that answer contains.</p>

<p class="ind">Upon the subject of Italy your Majesty reminds Viscount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.428" id="pageiii.428"></a>[page&nbsp;428]</span>
Palmerston that he stated last summer that it would be better
for the interests of England that Southern Italy should be a
separate Monarchy, rather than that it should form part of
an united Italy. Viscount Palmerston still retains that
opinion; because a separate kingdom of the Two Sicilies
would be more likely, in the event of war between England
and France, to side, at least by its neutrality, with the
strongest Naval Power, and it is to be hoped that such
Power would be England. But then it would be necessary
that the Two Sicilies as an independent and separate State
should be well governed, and should have an enlightened
Sovereign. This unfortunately has become hopeless and
impossible under the Bourbon Dynasty, and no Englishman
could wish to see a Murat or a Prince Napoleon on the Throne
of Naples.<sup>4</sup> The course of events since last summer seems to
have finally decided the fate of Sicily and Naples, and there
can be no doubt that for the interest of the people of Italy,
and with a view to the general balance of Power in Europe,
a united Italy is the best arrangement. The Italian Kingdom
will never side with France from partiality to France, and the
stronger that kingdom becomes the better able it will be to
resist political coercion from France. The chief hold that
France will have upon the policy of the Kingdom of Italy
consists in the retention of Venetia by Austria.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston has heard no more from Lord John
Russell about his wish eventually to go to the House of Lords,
and it is probable that this wish often before expressed will,
as upon former occasions, be allowed to sleep undisturbed....</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 4: Prince Napoleon Murat, a son of Joachim Murat, King of Naples, 1808-1815, had
returned to France from the United States in 1848; an attempt was now being made

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter enclosing
his correspondence with Lord Clarendon.<sup>5</sup> She has kept the
latter in order to show it to Lord Palmerston this evening, not
knowing whether he has seen it already. She must say that
Lord Clarendon's arguments are very conclusive. Has it
ever occurred to Lord John Russell that, if Lord Clarendon
were to go to Berlin carrying the highest compliment the
Queen has to bestow, viz. the Order of the Garter to the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.429" id="pageiii.429"></a>[page&nbsp;429]</span>
King of Prussia, and from thence to Vienna empty-handed
to the Emperor of Austria for the purpose of giving good
advice, the Emperor might look upon it as an offensive public
proceeding towards him?</p>

<span class="rightnote">CONSERVATIVE OVERTURES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>27th January 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty....</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston saw Lord Malmesbury on Friday before
the Cabinet. They both came up in the same train though not
in the same carriage, and Lord Malmesbury came to Viscount
Palmerston's in Piccadilly at three o'clock.</p>

<p class="ind">He said that he was charged by Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli
with a message similar to that which he had conveyed last
year, namely, that if Mr Gladstone were to propose a democratic
Budget making a great transfer of burthens from indirect
to direct Taxation, and if, the Cabinet refusing its concurrence,
Mr Gladstone were to retire, the Conservative Party
would give the Government substantial support except in
the case of the Government wishing to take an active part in
war against Austria. That this did not of course mean an
abstinence from usual attacks and criticisms in debate, but
that no step would in such case be taken to produce a change
of Government. In fact, said Lord Malmesbury, neither the
Conservative leaders nor the Party wish at present to come
into office, and have no intention of taking any step to turn
the present Government out. Mr Bright had indeed proposed
to Mr Disraeli to join together with the Radical Party, the
Conservatives, for the purpose of turning out the present
Government; and especially to get rid of Viscount Palmerston
and Lord John Russell. Mr Bright said he would in that case
give the Conservative Government a two years' existence,
and by the end of that time the country, it might be hoped,
would be prepared for a good and real Reform Bill, and then
a proper Government might be formed.</p>

<p class="ind">This proposal, which it must be owned was not very tempting,
Lord Malmesbury said had been declined. He also said
that Count Persigny, on returning from one of his trips to
Paris, had brought a similar proposal from Mr Cobden for
a co-operation of Radicals and Conservatives to overthrow the
present Government; but that also had been declined. Viscount
Palmerston requested Lord Malmesbury to convey his
thanks to Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli for the handsome communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.430" id="pageiii.430"></a>[page&nbsp;430]</span>
which they had thus made to him, and to assure
them that he fully appreciated the honourable and patriotic
motives by which it had been prompted....</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE PROVOSTSHIP OF ETON</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">94 Piccadilly</span>, <i>10th February 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Phipps</span>,&mdash;In the box which I sent to the Queen
on Friday morning, giving a short account of the Debate on
Thursday, I placed a separate paper submitting for her approval<span class="rightnote">DR GOODFORD</span>
that Dr Goodford, Headmaster of Eton, might be recommended
to the Fellows to be elected to the office of Provost now
vacant; and I mentioned that the matter was rather pressing.
I have had no answer as yet, and the election is fixed for
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="ind">The election is on the same footing as that of a bishop who
is nominally elected by the Chapter of the Diocese, but who is
named for being so elected by the Crown. The Crown recommends
the person to be named Provost, and the Fellows as a
matter of course elect him. But the election must be made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.431" id="pageiii.431"></a>[page&nbsp;431]</span>
within a stated period&mdash;I believe fifteen days after the vacancy
has happened; and if the Crown does not within that period
recommend, the Fellows proceed to make their own choice.</p>

<p class="ind">The election is fixed for to-morrow, and it would not, I
think, be desirable to let the Royal prerogative drop on this
occasion. The persons who have been named as candidates
are Dr Goodford, Headmaster, and with regard to him it is to
be said that the office has generally been given to the Headmaster,
and that, as far as the Provost has any function connected
with improvements in the arrangement of the school,
there is an advantage in his having been conversant with the
details of the existing system. Dr Goodford is qualified for
the office by his degree.</p>

<p class="ind">The next candidate is Mr Coleridge, once a master in the
school, but he is not qualified by a sufficient degree, and
there was a prejudice against him on account of his Puseyite
tendencies.</p>

<p class="ind">The third is Dr Chapman, late Bishop of Colombo, qualified
by his degree, but having no peculiar claims or other recommendations
for the office.</p>

<p class="ind">The fourth is Mr Birch, formerly tutor to the Prince of Wales,
scarcely of sufficient calibre for the office, and not qualified by
a sufficient degree.</p>

<p class="ind">Between Dr Goodford and Dr Chapman I think the preference
should be given to Dr Goodford, and the more especially
because Dr Chapman is supposed to entertain theological
opinions similar to those of Mr Coleridge, his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="ind">If the Queen should approve of Dr Goodford being recommended,
perhaps she would have the goodness to sign the
document sent in the accompanying box, and if it is returned
by the earliest opportunity it is just possible that I may be
able to send it to Windsor in time for the election to-morrow.<sup>6</sup>
Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="indright"><i>10th February 1861.</i></p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter enclosing
the draft of one to General Garibaldi, which she now returns.
She had much doubt about its being altogether safe for the
Government to get into correspondence, however unofficial,
with the General, and thinks that it would be better for Lord
John <i>not</i> to write to him. Lord Palmerston, who was here this
afternoon on other business, has undertaken to explain the
reasons in detail to Lord John&mdash;in which he fully concurs.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty;
he earnestly entreats your Majesty to consider whether any
step ought to be omitted by which the peace of Europe may
be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'preseved'">preserved</ins>.</p>

<p class="ind">General Garibaldi is generally esteemed by Italians; even
Count Ludolf speaks of him in the highest terms of praise.
General Garibaldi has lost his country, and is full of resentment
at Count Cavour for selling it. He respects and admires
England for her disinterested conduct.</p>

<p class="ind">But it is evident the French Emperor is again exciting the
Hungarian party. The Garibaldian legion is told to hold itself
in readiness, and the <i>Pays</i> and <i>Patrie</i> are instructed to praise
the Legion. They are being assembled in Genoa and Piedmont.</p>

<p class="ind">There is little chance of Garibaldi's refusing to take part in
this expedition, and if he does proceed to the Dalmatian or
Istrian coast, his name will have an immense effect.</p>

<p class="ind">It does not seem reasonable to throw away any chance of
saving the Austrian Empire and the peace of Europe.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell will wait till Monday next to learn
definitively your Majesty's pleasure.</p>

<p class="ind">The proposed letter appears to him to give some hope of
preventing great misfortunes. In this belief it is Lord John
Russell's duty to endeavour to prevent the frightful war which
is impending.</p>

<p class="ind">Kossuth is fabricating paper to the extent of from 140 to
300,000,000 of florins to furnish the sinews of insurrection.
In the month of March Hungary will be in a blaze. But if
Italy, Germany, and France keep away, the fire may burn
out of itself.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your

that as Lord John is so anxious to send it, and seems so strongly
of opinion that it is an effort which might be successful in
dissuading Garibaldi from attempting to create disturbances in
the Austrian territory by going thither with a band of adventurers,
it may be best to let the letter go, though it might
perhaps be improved by pointing more directly to the nature of
the expedition which it advises Garibaldi not to undertake.</p>

<p class="ind">There may be inconveniences which may arise from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.433" id="pageiii.433"></a>[page&nbsp;433]</span>
letter, but they might be dealt with; on the other hand, if
Garibaldi undertakes his expedition, it would be a matter of
regret if it could be thought or said that a step which might
have prevented the mischief had been omitted.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord John Russell's reiterated
request for her sanction to his writing to General Garibaldi.
She still entertains the same objections to the step, as implying
a recognition of the General's position as a European Power
as enabling him to allow the impression to prevail, that he is in
communication with the British Government and acts under
its inspiration, as possibly leading to a prolonged and embarrassing
correspondence, and as implying for the future
that when the disapprobation of the Government is not
expressed (as in the present instance), it gives its consent to
his aggressive schemes. The Queen will not prevent, however,
Lord John from taking a step which he considers gives a chance
of averting a great European calamity. Should Lord John
therefore adhere to his opinion, she asks him to let her see the
letter again, upon the precise wording of which so much
depends.</p>

We have found many most interesting and valuable letters&mdash;the

from <i>my</i> poor father asking for dearest Mamma's hand&mdash;and
sending a letter from you, encouraging him to ask her. And

<span class="rightnote">FATHERLY ADVICE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>1st April 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Victoria</span>,&mdash;Your dear letter of the 30th
<i>moved me very much</i>. I can see everything, and it makes me
shed tears of the sincerest sorrow.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.438" id="pageiii.438"></a>[page&nbsp;438]</span>

<p class="ind">The bereavement, the impossibility, they are what one feels
most deeply and painfully, that nothing will bring back the
beloved object, that there is a rupture with everything earthly
that nothing can remedy. Your good, dear Mamma was
without ostentation, sincerely religious, a great blessing, and
the only solid support we can find. Happy those whose faith
cannot be shaken; they can bear the hardships of earthly life
with fortitude.</p>

<p class="ind">True it is that if we compare the sorrows of our earthly life
with the hope of an eternal existence, though painfully felt,
still they shrink as it were in appreciation.</p>

<p class="ind">You feel so <i>truly</i>, so <i>affectionately</i>, that even in that you
must gratify the dear being we lost. When I think of poor
Aunt Julia,<sup>12</sup> she was so alone that I cannot help to pity her
even in all the objects she valued and left behind; the affectionate
care which is shown to everything connected with
your dear Mamma could not have existed, and still she was
a noble character, and with a warm, generous heart. In all
your dear Mamma's letters there will everywhere be found
traces of the affection which united us. From early childhood
we were close allies; she recollected everything so well of that
period which now, since the departure of the two sisters, is
totally unknown to every one but me, which, you can imagine,
is a most melancholy sensation. Time flies so fast that all
dear recollections soon get isolated. Your stay at Osborne
will do you good, though Spring, when fine, affects one very
much, to think that the one that was beloved does not share
in these pleasant sensations. You must try, however, not
to shake your precious health too much. Your dear Mamma,
who watched your looks so affectionately, would not approve
of it.... Your devoted old Uncle,</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE DANISH QUESTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>27th May 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen returns the proposed draft of answer to the
observations of the Russian Government on Lord John Russell's
proposals with regard to the Danish Question. She has to
observe that this reverses the whole position taken by us
hitherto. Prince Gortschakoff is quite right in reminding us
that the engagements taken in 1852<sup>13</sup> did not contain a formal
guarantee (<i>obliging</i> to take up arms for the defence of the
object guaranteed) in deference to the opinion of the British
Government which, on general principles, has always objected
to such engagements. These principles are as important now
as ever, and yet Lord John proposes "to renew the <i>guarantee</i>
of the integrity of the Danish Monarchy contained in the
Treaty of 8th May 1852," thereby giving those engagements
the force of a guarantee, which was on principle objected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.440" id="pageiii.440"></a>[page&nbsp;440]</span>
by us at the time. Both Russia and France in their answers
object to such a guarantee now, even with regard to Schleswig
alone, as involving the guaranteeing powers in future grave
difficulties, and Lord John proposes to extend it to Holstein,
a part of Germany and not of Denmark, by way of obviating
the difficulty. The Queen cannot give her sanction to this
proposal.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 13: A Treaty was signed by the European Powers on the 8th of May 1852, by which the
succession of the line of Sonderburg-Gl&uuml;cksburg to the Danish throne was settled, and
the integrity of the kingdom guaranteed. See <i>ante</i>, <a href="../../24780/24780-h/24780-h.htm#pageii.358" style="font-weight: normal;">vol. ii. p. 358</a>.

<p class="ind">The Queen returns these papers. She thinks it of great
importance that we should be strong in Canada, and thinks
an increase in Artillery as important as the sending of two more
battalions, as that Arm cannot be supplied at all by the Colony.
The Naval forces would, however, require strengthening even
more. It is less likely that the remnant of the United States
could send expeditions by land to the North while quarrelling
with the South, than that they should commit acts of violence
at sea.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has perused the accompanying draft to Sir
James Hudson. She is of opinion that so important a step as
proposals on our part for the solution of the Roman Question,
with which we are not directly concerned, and for the solution
of which we are for many obvious reasons perhaps the Power
possessing the least favourable position, is a subject of such
great importance, that it should not be undertaken without
the most mature consideration. Has this draft been brought
before the Cabinet? The Queen wishes to have their united
advice before giving her decision. Her opinion at present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.441" id="pageiii.441"></a>[page&nbsp;441]</span>
is against our volunteering a scheme which will render us
responsible for the result of grave complications, from which
we have hitherto stood happily quite clear. The Queen wishes
these lines to be communicated to the Cabinet.<sup>15</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 15: Lord John Russell had written that the withdrawal of the French troops from Rome
would probably be followed by tumults and bloodshed; and as both the Roman party
and Garibaldi hated the Government of the Pope, and wished to put an end to his temporal
power, he suggested that the Pope should be allowed to retain his sovereignty
during his lifetime, in a restricted territory and with restricted powers; that Italian
troops should occupy the towns and villages outside a limit of five miles from Rome;
and that the King of Italy and the Emperor of the French should agree not to recognise
the temporal power of any future Pope.

administrator of an important branch of your Majesty's service.<sup>17</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston is not aware whether by the regulations
of the Order the Garter could be sent out to Lord Canning
in India. If that were possible, it might have the double

advantage of strengthening his hands during the remainder of
his stay, by affording so public a mark of your Majesty's
approval; and moreover of making sure that Lord Canning
should receive this mark of your Majesty's royal favour, while
the Government is in the hands of an administration similar
to that at whose recommendation he was sent out, which
perhaps might be more agreeable to his feelings than running
the chance, always possible, though Viscount Palmerston hopes
it may not be probable, that political combinations might,
before his return in May or June 1862, have produced administrative
changes.</p>

he feared I might resign, saying that I knew what an interest
it had been to him, how he had liked hearing of the Queen and

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>8th July 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that Lord Elcho<sup>20</sup> this afternoon
moved a Resolution that the new Foreign Office should not
be built in the Palladian style. Mr Charles Buxton seconded
the Motion. Mr Cowper<sup>21</sup> opposed it, stating reasons for preferring
the Italian style to the Gothic. Mr Layard was for
neither, but seemed to wish that somebody would invent a
new style of architecture. Mr Tite,<sup>22</sup> the architect, was strongly
for the Italian style; Lord John Manners, swayed by erroneous
views in religion and taste, was enthusiastic for
Gothic;<sup>23</sup> Mr Dudley Fortescue confided in a low voice to a
limited range of hearers some weak arguments in favour of
Gothic; Mr Osborne seemed to be against everything that
anybody had ever proposed, and wanted to put off the building
till some plan better suited to his own taste should have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.444" id="pageiii.444"></a>[page&nbsp;444]</span>
invented. Viscount Palmerston answered the objections
made to the Italian plan, and Lord Elcho's Motion was negatived
by 188 to 75. The House then went into Committee
of Supply, and the first estimate being that for the Foreign
Office, some of the Gothic party who had not been able to
deliver their speeches on Lord Elcho's Motion, let them off
on this estimate....</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 23: Mr Gilbert Scott had made his first designs for the new Foreign Office in the Gothic
style; his appointment as architect for the building was made by the Derby Government,
but the scheme which they favoured, for a Gothic building, was opposed by Lord
Palmerston, and Scott adopted the Italian style in deference to his views.

<p class="ind">The Queen is sorry that she cannot alter her determination
about Mr Layard.<sup>24</sup> She fully recognises the importance of
the Parliamentary exigencies; but the Queen cannot sacrifice
to them the higher interests of the country. Neither Mr
Layard nor Mr Osborne ought to be proposed as representatives
of the Foreign Office in the House of Commons, and therefore
of the Crown to foreign countries. If Lord Palmerston can
bring Mr Layard into office in some other place, to get his
assistance in the House of Commons, she will not object.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 24: In the course of July, Lord John Russell, who had entered Parliament for the first
time in 1813, was raised to the Peerage as Earl Russell and Viscount Amberley. To
supply the loss to the Government of two such powerful debaters as Lord Russell and
Lord Herbert, Lord Palmerston had suggested Mr Layard as Under-Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, mentioning also the claims of Mr Bernal Osborne.

<span class="rightnote">MR LAYARD</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">94 Piccadilly</span>, <i>24th July 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and regrets very much to find that he has not succeeded
in removing your Majesty's objections to Mr Layard
as Under-Secretary of State for the Foreign Department;
but he still hopes that he may be able to do so. If he rightly
understands your Majesty's last communication on this subject,
he is led to infer that your Majesty's main objection is
founded on a dislike that Mr Layard should be the representative
and organ of the Foreign Policy of the Crown in the House
of Commons.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to his being a subordinate officer in the Foreign
Office, your Majesty's sanction to that was obtained in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '1831-52'">1851-52</ins>,
when Mr Layard was Under-Secretary to Lord Granville.
His tenure of office at that time was short; not from any
fault of his, but because the Government of that day was overthrown
by Viscount Palmerston's Motion in the House of
Commons in February 1852 about the Militia; and Lord
Granville speaks highly of Mr Layard's performance of his
official duties at that time. There is no reason, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.445" id="pageiii.445"></a>[page&nbsp;445]</span>
reverse, for thinking him less competent now than then;
and an Under-Secretary of State is only the instrument and
mouthpiece of his principal to say what he is told, and to
write what he is bid.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to Mr Layard's position in the House of Commons,
he would in no respect be the representative of the
Foreign Policy of the country; that function will belong to
Viscount Palmerston, now that the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs will be removed to the House of Lords, and it
will be Viscount Palmerston's duty and care to see that
nobody infringes upon that function. Mr Layard would be
useful to answer unimportant questions as to matters of
fact, but all questions involving the Foreign Policy of the
country will be answered by Viscount Palmerston as head of
the Government, as was done when Lord Clarendon was
Foreign Secretary and in the House of Lords. But there are
not unfrequently great debates on Foreign Affairs in the
House of Commons, and there are many members, some of
them not perhaps of great weight, who join in attacks on such
matters. It is of great importance to your Majesty's Government
to have a sufficient number of speakers on such occasions.
Lord John Russell and Lord Herbert were ready and
powerful. Mr Gladstone is almost the only one on the Treasury
Bench who follows up foreign questions close enough to
take an active part; it would be of great advantage to Viscount
Palmerston to have as assistant on such occasions a man like
Mr Layard, knowing the details of matters discussed, able to
make a good speech in reply to Mr Fitzgerald, or Mr Baillie
Cochrane,<sup>25</sup> or Mr Hennessy,<sup>26</sup> or Sir G. Bowyer,<sup>27</sup> and who would
shape his course in strict conformity with the line which
might be chalked out for him by Viscount Palmerston. Your
Majesty need therefore be under no apprehension that Mr
Layard or anybody else, who might in the House of Commons
hold the office of Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
would appear to the world as the organ or representative
of the Foreign Policy of your Majesty's Government. With
respect to giving Mr Layard any other office of the same kind,
there is none other in which he could be placed without putting
into the Foreign Office somebody far less fit for it, and putting
Mr Layard into some office for which he is far less fit. His
fitness is for the Foreign Department, and to use the illustration,
which was a favourite one of the late Mr Drummond,
it would be putting the wrong man into the wrong hole.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.446" id="pageiii.446"></a>[page&nbsp;446]</span>
Viscount Palmerston has, as charged with the conduct of
the business of the Government in the House of Commons,
sustained a severe loss by the removal of two most able and
useful colleagues, Lord Herbert and Lord John Russell, and
he earnestly hopes that your Majesty will be graciously
pleased to assist him in his endeavours, not indeed to supply
their place, but in some degree to lessen the detriment which
their removal has occasioned.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>25th July 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Prince has reported to the Queen all that Lord
Palmerston said to him on the subject of Mr Layard; this has
not had the effect of altering her opinion as to the disqualifications
of that gentleman for the particular office for which
Lord Palmerston proposes him. This appointment would,
in the Queen's opinion, be a serious evil. If Lord Palmerston
on sincere self-examination should consider that without it
the difficulty of carrying on his Government was such as to
endanger the continuance of its success, the Queen will, of
course, have to admit an evil for the country in order to avert
a greater. She still trusts, however, that knowing the nature
of the Queen's objections, he will not place her in this dilemma.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">94 Piccadilly</span>, <i>26th July 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to be allowed to make his grateful and
respectful acknowledgments for your Majesty's gracious and
condescending acquiescence in his recommendation of Mr
Layard for the appointment of Under-Secretary of State for
the Foreign Department. It is always a source of most
sincere pain to Viscount Palmerston to find himself differing,
on any point, in opinion with your Majesty, a respect for
whose soundness of judgment, and clearness of understanding,
must always lead him to distrust the value of his own conclusions
when they differ from those to which your Majesty
has arrived. But the question about Mr Layard turned
mainly upon considerations connected with the conduct of
public business of your Majesty's Government in the House
of Commons.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston sits in that House four days in every
week during the Session of Parliament, from half-past four in
the afternoon to any hour however late after midnight at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.447" id="pageiii.447"></a>[page&nbsp;447]</span>
which the House may adjourn. It is his duty carefully to
watch the proceedings of the House, and to observe and
measure the fluctuating bearings of Party and of sectional
associations on the present position of the Government, and
on its chances for the future; and he is thus led to form
conclusions as to persons and parties which may not equally
strike, or with equal force, those who from without and from
higher regions may see general results without being eye- and
ear-witnesses of the many small and successive details
out of which those results are built up.</p>

<p class="ind">It was thus that Viscount Palmerston was led to a strong
conviction that the proposed appointment of Mr Layard
would be a great advantage to your Majesty's Government
as regards the conduct of business in the House of Commons,
and the position of your Majesty's Government in that House;
and he is satisfied that he will be able to prevent Mr Layard
in any subsidiary part which he may have to take in any
discussion on foreign questions, from departing from the line
which may be traced out for him by Lord John Russell and
Viscount Palmerston....</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>13th August 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;Since Saturday we have great heat.
<i>Our</i> King of Sweden<sup>28</sup> arrived yesterday evening. We went
out in the yacht to meet him, and did so; but his ship going
slow, the <i>dress</i> of the <i>hohen Herrn only</i> arrived at a quarter to
nine, and we only sat down to dinner at a quarter past nine!
The King and Prince Oscar<sup>29</sup> are very French, and very
Italian! I think that there is a dream of a Scandinavian
Kingdom floating before them. The King is a fine-looking
man.... He is not at all difficult to get on with, and is very
civil. Oscar is very amiable and mild, and very proud of his
three little boys. They leave again quite early to-morrow.</p>

<p class="ind">Our <i>dear</i> children leave us, alas! on Friday quite early,
for Antwerp.<sup>30</sup> It will again be a painful trial! Their stay
has been very pleasant and <i>gem&uuml;thlich</i>, and we have seen more
of and known dear Fritz more thoroughly than we ever did
before, and really he is <i>very</i> excellent, and would, I am convinced,
make an excellent King. The little children are <i>very
great</i> darlings, and we shall miss them sadly.</p>

<p class="ind">On the 16th we go to poor, dear Frogmore, and on the 17th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.448" id="pageiii.448"></a>[page&nbsp;448]</span>
we shall visit that dear grave! Last year she was still so
well, and so full of life; but it was a <i>very</i> sad birthday, two
days after the loss of that dear beloved sister, whom she has
joined so soon! Oh! the agony of <i>Wehmuth</i>, the bitterness
of the blank, do <i>not</i> get better with time! Beloved Mamma,
how hourly she is in my mind!</p>

<p class="ind">The King of Prussia will have great pleasure in visiting you

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">SWEDISH POLITICS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>14th August 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and hastens to answer the enquiry contained in your
Majesty's note, which was delivered to him at Southampton.
He must, in the first place, explain that much of what was
said to him by the King of Sweden and by Prince Oscar was
not clearly understood by him. They would both speak
English&mdash;which they spoke with difficulty and in an indistinct
utterance of voice&mdash;and he did not like to break the conversation
into French, because to have done so would have
looked like a condemnation of their English, of any imperfection
of which they did not seem to be at all conscious.</p>

<p class="ind">The King was very guarded in all he said about France;
the Prince spoke with more freedom and with less caution.
The result of what Viscount Palmerston gathered from their
conversation, and perhaps for this purpose they may be put
together, because they probably both feel and think nearly
alike, though the Prince lets his thoughts out more than the
King, may be summed up as follows.</p>

<p class="ind">They were much pleased and flattered by the kind and
friendly reception given them by the French Emperor, and
both he and they seem to have had present to their minds
that the existing Royal Family of Sweden is descended from
General Bernadotte&mdash;a General in the Army of the First
Napoleon. They think the French Emperor sincerely desirous
of maintaining his alliance with England, believing it to be
for his interest to do so. But they consider the French
Nation essentially aggressive, and they think that the Emperor
is obliged to humour that national feeling, and to follow, as
far as the difference of circumstances will allow, the policy of
his Uncle. They consider the principle of nationalities to be
the deciding principle of the day, and accordingly Venetia
ought to belong to Italy, Poland ought to be severed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.449" id="pageiii.449"></a>[page&nbsp;449]</span>
Russia, and Finland ought to be restored to Sweden. Holstein
should be purely German with its own Duke, Schleswig should
be united to Denmark, and when the proper time comes,
Denmark, so constituted, ought to form one Monarchy with
Sweden and Norway. But they see that there are great if
not insuperable obstacles to all these arrangements, and they
do not admit that the Emperor of the French talked to them
about these things, or about the map of Europe revised for
1860. They lamented the dangerous state of the Austrian
Empire by reason of its financial embarrassments, and its
differences between Vienna and Hungary. They admitted
the difficulty of re-establishing a Polish State, seeing that
Russia, Prussia, and Austria are all interested in preventing
it; but they thought that Russia might make herself amends
to the Eastward for giving up part of her Polish possessions.</p>

<p class="ind">They said the Swedes would be more adverse than the
Danes to a Union of Denmark with Sweden. They said the
Finns are writhing under the Russian yoke, and emigrate in
considerable numbers to Sweden. They think Russia paralysed
for ten years to come by her war against England and
France, by her internal changes, and her money embarrassments.
When the Prince asked Viscount Palmerston to sit
down, it was for the purpose of urging in the strongest and
most earnest manner that some British ships of war, or even
one single gunboat, if more could not be spared, should every
year visit the Baltic, and make a cruise in that sea. He said
that the British Flag was never seen there, although Great
Britain has great interests, commercial and political, in that
sea. That especially for Sweden it would be a great support
if a British man-of-war were every year to show itself in
Swedish waters. He said that our Navy know little or nothing
of the Baltic, and when a war comes, as happened in the late
war with Russia, our ships are obliged, as it were, to feel their
way about in the dark; that the Russians send ships of war
into British ports&mdash;why should not England send ships of war
into Russian ports? That we survey seas at the other side
of the Globe, why should we not survey a sea so near to us as
the Baltic; that as far as Sweden is concerned, British ships
would be most cordially received. I said that this should
receive due consideration; and in answer to a question he
said the best time for a Baltic cruise would be from the middle
of June to the latter end of August.</p>

<p class="ind">They both thought the Emperor of the French extremely
popular in France&mdash;but, of course, they only saw outward
demonstrations. They are very anxious for the maintenance
of the Anglo-French Alliance; and they think the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.450" id="pageiii.450"></a>[page&nbsp;450]</span>
obliged to keep a large Army and to build a strong Navy in
order to please and satisfy the French Nation. Such is the
summary of the impression made upon Viscount Palmerston
by the answers and observations drawn out by him in his
conversations with the King and the Prince; most of these
things were said as above reported, some few of the above
statements are perhaps inferences and conclusions drawn
from indirect answers and remarks.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is very much obliged to Lord Palmerston for his
detailed account of his conversation with the King of Sweden,
and sends both Memorandums back to him in accordance
with his wishes, in the expectation of having them returned
to her after they shall have been copied.</p>
<span class="rightnote">FRANCE AND SWEDEN</span>
<p class="ind">The King may have been embarrassed by the presence of
the Crown Prince of Prussia here at Osborne, and have on
that account postponed speaking openly to Lord Palmerston.
His desire to acquire Denmark and Finland is not unnatural,
and would not be very dangerous; but the important part
of the matter is, that the Emperor Napoleon has evidently
tried to bribe him for his schemes by such expectations. After
having established a large kingdom, dependent upon him and
possessing a fleet, in the South of Europe on his right flank,
he evidently tries to establish by the same means a similar
power on his left flank in the North. If then the Revolution
of Poland and Hungary takes Germany also in the rear, he
will be exactly in the all-powerful position which his Uncle
held, and at which he himself aims, with that one difference:
that, unlike his Uncle, who had to fight England all the time
(who defended desperately her interests in Europe), he tries
to effect his purposes in alliance with England, and uses for
this end our own <i>free</i> Press and in our own free country!</p>

<p class="ind">The Polish and Hungarian Revolutions (perhaps the
Russian) and the assistance which may be (nobly?) given
to them by Sweden, can easily be made as popular in this
country as the Italian has, and efforts to produce this result
are fully visible already. The position and prospects of the
Ally, when the Emperor shall have the whole Continent at
his feet, and the command of the Mediterranean and the
Baltic, will not be a very pleasant one. Moreover, the Ally
will probably have irritated him and the French Nation all
the time by abusing them, and by showing that, although
we may have approved of her policy, we did not intend that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.451" id="pageiii.451"></a>[page&nbsp;451]</span>
France should reap any benefits from it. All this is probably
not thought of by our journalists, but requires the serious
attention of our statesmen.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Palmerston will perhaps show this letter to Lord
Russell when he sends him the copies of the Memoranda,
which he will probably do.</p>

<p class="ind">We parted from our dear children and grandchildren with

been most peaceful and satisfactory, and we have learnt to
know and most highly appreciate the great <i>excellence</i> of dear

slept. The first evening was terribly trying, and I must say

and yet <i>she</i> was not there! But I got calmer; the very
fact of being surrounded by all she liked, and of seeing the
dear pretty house inhabited again, was a satisfaction, and
the next morning was beautiful, and we went after breakfast
with wreaths up to the Mausoleum, and into the vault which
is <i>&agrave; plain-pied</i>, and so pretty&mdash;so airy&mdash;<i>so</i> grand and simple,
that, affecting as it is, there was no anguish or bitterness of
grief, but calm repose! We placed the wreaths upon the
splendid granite sarcophagus, and at its feet, and <i>felt</i> that
<i>only</i> the <i>earthly robe</i> we loved so much was there. The pure,
tender, loving spirit <i>which loved us</i> so tenderly, is above us&mdash;loving
us, praying for us, and <i>free</i> from <i>all</i> suffering and
woe&mdash;<i>yes</i>,
that <i>is</i> a <i>comfort</i>, and that <i>first birthday</i> in
<i>another</i> world
must have been a <i>far</i> brighter one than <i>any</i> in this poor world
below! I only grieve <i>now</i> that we should be going so far
away from Frogmore, as I long to go there; only Alice and
dear Augusta Bruce<sup>31</sup>(who feels as a daughter of hers) went

<span class="rightnote">THE COURT OF HANOVER</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Hanover</span> [<i>Undated. October 1861</i>].</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Madam</span>,&mdash;Though your Majesty has only very lately seen
the Princess Royal, I cannot refrain from addressing your
Majesty, as I am sure your Majesty will be pleased to hear
how well Her Royal Highness was looking during the Man&oelig;uvres
on the Rhine, and how much she seems to be beloved,
not only by all those who know her, but also by those who
have only seen and heard of her. The English could not help
feeling proud of the way the Princess Royal was spoken of,
and the high esteem she is held in. For one so young it is a
most flattering position, and certainly as the Princess's charm
of manner and her kind unaffected words had in that short
time won her the hearts of all the officers and strangers present,
one was not astonished at the praise the Prussians themselves
bestow on Her Royal Highness. The Royal Family is so
large, and their opinions politically and socially sometimes
so different, that it must have been very difficult indeed at
first for the Princess Royal, and people therefore cannot praise
enough the high principles, great discretion, sound judgment,
and cleverness Her Royal Highness has invariably displayed.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty would have been amused to hear General
Wrangel<a id="footnotetagXXX37" name="footnotetagXXX37"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX37"><sup>37</sup></a> tell at the top of his voice how delighted the soldiers
were to see the Princess on horseback, and the interest she
showed for them. What pleased them specially was to see
Her Royal Highness ride without a veil&mdash;such an odd thing
in soldiers to remark. The King of Prussia is looking very
well, but the Queen I thought very much altered. Her
Majesty looks very pale and tired, and has such a painful
drawn look about the mouth. How the Queen will be able
to go through all the fatigues of the Coronation I do not know,
as Her Majesty already complained of being tired, and knocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.455" id="pageiii.455"></a>[page&nbsp;455]</span>
up by the man&oelig;vres and dinners, and had to go to Mentz
for a few days to rest herself. Their Majesties' kindness was
very great, and the Duke told me of the extreme hospitality
with which they were entertained. Every one, high and low,
were rivalling each other in civility and friendliness towards
the strangers, especially the English, and one really felt quite
ashamed of those wanton attacks the <i>Times</i> always makes
on Prussia, and which are read and copied into all the Prussian
papers. The last night all the officers dined together. General
Forey put himself into the President's place and insisted, to
the exclusion of Lord Clyde, who was by far the senior officer,
and who was expected to do it, on proposing the health of
the King, the Royal Family, the Army, and Nation. Not
content with doing it in French, he drew out of his pocket a
document written for him in German, for he did not know the
language, and read it with the most extraordinary pronunciation.
The English officers all admired the way the Germans
kept their countenance notwithstanding the absurdity of the
exhibition.</p>

<p class="ind">On the 21st they have had great doings here at Hanover.
I hear that to the astonishment of everybody the Queen
appeared at the <i>Enth&uuml;llung</i>, where all other people were <i>en
grande tenue</i>, in a little small round hat with a lilac feather.
Her Maids of Honour&mdash;she has only one now besides that
English Miss Stewart&mdash;were ordered to wear hats to keep
Her Majesty in countenance. I wonder if your Majesty has
read the speech the King has addressed to his people on the
occasion of the <i>Enth&uuml;llung</i> and the Crown Prince's birthday.
It cannot fail to excite the greatest pity that such things,
however well meant, should be written. Has your Majesty
also heard of the pamphlet that has been published here
called <i>Das Welfe</i>&mdash;that name Welfe is quite an <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> of
the King now, and he brings it in on every occasion, and this
pamphlet is written throwing the whole idea into ridicule,
and beginning with the last years of the late King's reign.
The Crown Prince<sup>38</sup> is very much liked, but, unfortunately,
his new tutor will probably also leave very shortly&mdash;he has
no authority over him, the Prince still regretting M. de Issendorf.
Besides, he is not allowed to exercise his judgment in
the smallest way&mdash;the King going on the principle that a
King only can educate a King. The reason the other tutor
left, or was dismissed, was partly on account of his remonstrating
against the religious instructions, which were carried
so far that the Prince had hardly any time left to learn other
things. Besides the Prince, who dislikes the clergyman, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.456" id="pageiii.456"></a>[page&nbsp;456]</span>
drawn a caricature, to which the man very much gives himself,
and the King thought M. de Issendorf had known of it, which
turned out not to be the case.... I have the honour to
remain, your Majesty's most obedient and devoted Servant
and Subject,</p>

<span class="rightnote">CORONATION OF KING OF PRUSSIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">K&ouml;nisberg</span>, <i>19th October 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Mamma</span>,&mdash;Last night I could not write to you
as I would have wished, because I felt so knocked up that I
went to bed. I have got such a very bad cold on my chest,
with a cough that leaves me no rest, and of course cannot
take care of myself, and am obliged to stand and sit in every
sort of draught with a low gown and without a cloak, so it is
no wonder to have caught cold. I have not had a cough
since I don't know when. I should like to be able to describe
yesterday's ceremony to you, but I cannot find words to tell
you how fine and how touching it was; it really was a magnificent
sight! The King looked so very handsome and so
noble with the crown on; it seemed to suit him so exactly.
The Queen, too, looked beautiful, and did all she had to do
with perfect grace, and looked so <i>vornehm</i>; I assure you the
whole must have made a great impression on everybody
present, and all those to whom I have talked on the subject
quite share my feeling. The moment when the King put the
crown on the Queen's head was very touching, I think there
was hardly a dry eye in the church. The <i>Schlosshof</i> was the
finest, I thought&mdash;five bands playing "God save the Queen,"
banners waving in all directions, cheers so loud that they quite
drowned the sound of the music, and the procession moving
slowly on, the sky without a cloud; and all the uniforms,
and the ladies' diamonds glittering in the bright sunlight.
I shall never forget it all, it was so very fine! Dearest
Fritz's birthday being chosen for the day made me very happy;
he was in a great state of emotion and excitement, as you
can imagine, as we all were. Mr Thomas<a id="footnotetagXXX39" name="footnotetagXXX39"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX39"><sup>39</sup></a> was in the chapel.
I hope he will have been able to take down some useful
memoranda. The Grand Duke of Weimar,<a id="footnotetagXXX40" name="footnotetagXXX40"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX40"><sup>40</sup></a> the King and
ourselves, have ordered drawings of him.</p>
<span class="rightnote">A BRILLIANT CEREMONY</span>
<p class="ind">The <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> was really beautiful; the chapel is in itself
lovely, with a great deal of gold about it, and all hung with
red velvet and gold&mdash;the carpet, altar, thrones and canopies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.457" id="pageiii.457"></a>[page&nbsp;457]</span>
the same. The Knights of the Black Eagle with red velvet
cloaks, the Queen's four young ladies all alike in white and
gold, the two Palastdamen in crimson velvet and gold, and
the Oberhofmeisterin in gold and white brocade with green
velvet, Marianne and Addy in red and gold and red and silver;
I, in gold with ermine and white satin, my ladies, one in blue
velvet, the other in red velvet, and Countess Schulenberg,
together with the two other Oberhofmeisterin of the other
Princesses, in violet velvet and gold. All these colours together
looked very beautiful, and the sun shone, or rather
poured in at the high windows, and gave quite magic tinges.</p>

<p class="ind">The music was very fine, the chorales were sung so loud
and strong that it really quite moved one. The King was
immensely cheered, wherever he appeared&mdash;also the Queen,
and even I.</p>

<p class="ind">There were illuminations last night, but I did not go to
see them, as I was too tired and felt so unwell. There are
five degrees of cold (R&eacute;aumur), and one is exposed to draughts
every minute.</p>

<p class="ind">Sixteen hundred people dined in the Schloss last night!
The King and Queen were most kind to me yesterday; the
King gave me a charming little locket for his hair, and only
think&mdash;what will sound most extraordinary, absurd, and incredible
to your ears&mdash;made me Second <i>Chef</i> of the 2nd
Regiment of Hussars! I laughed so much, because really I
thought it was a joke&mdash;it seemed so strange for ladies; but
the Regiments like particularly having ladies for their <i>Chefs!</i>
The Queen and the Queen Dowager have Regiments, but I
believe I am the first Princess on whom such an honour is
conferred.</p>
<span class="rightnote">DISTINGUISHED GUESTS</span>
<p class="ind">The Archduke addressed the King yesterday, in the name
of all the foreign Princes present, in a very pretty speech.</p>

<p class="ind">It is such a pleasure to see good Philip here, and the two
Portuguese cousins. Juan<a id="footnotetagXXX41" name="footnotetagXXX41"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX41"><sup>41</sup></a> is very nice, but he does not talk
much; he has a very fine, tall figure, and is nice-looking. I
should think he must be like his father. Prince Hohenzollern <a id="footnotetagXXX42" name="footnotetagXXX42"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX42"><sup>42</sup></a>
is become Royal Highness, and the title is to descend to his
eldest son. Half Europe is here, and one sees the funniest
combinations in the world. It is like a happy family shut
up in a cage! The Italian Ambassador sat near Cardinal
Geisel, and the French one opposite the Archduke. The
Grand Duke Nicolas is here&mdash;he is so nice&mdash;also the Crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.458" id="pageiii.458"></a>[page&nbsp;458]</span>

who wish to be most particularly remembered to you and
Papa.</p>

<p class="ind">The King and Queen are most kind to Lord Clarendon, and
make a marked difference between their marked cordiality to
him and the stiff etiquette with which the other Ambassadors
are received.</p>

<p class="ind">I think he is pleased with what he sees. The King has
given the Queen the Order of the Black Eagle in diamonds.
I write all these details, as you wish them, at the risk of their
not interesting you, besides my being, as you know, a very
bad hand at descriptions. I shall make a point of your
having newspapers.</p>

<p class="ind">I am unable to appear at the <i>cour</i> this morning, as my
cough is too violent: I hope to be able to be at the concert
this evening, but I own it seems very doubtful. The state
dinner looked very well; we were waited on by our <i>Kammerherren</i>
and pages&mdash;the King being waited on by the <i>Oberhofchargen</i>&mdash;and
our ladies stood behind our chairs. After the
first two dishes are round, the King asks to drink, and that
is the signal for the ladies and gentlemen to leave the room
and go to dinner, while the Pages of Honour continue to serve
the whole dinner really wonderfully well, poor boys, considering
it is no easy task.</p>

<p class="ind">To-morrow we leave K&ouml;nigsberg for Dantzic&mdash;we have not
had one day's bad weather here, nothing but sunshine and
a bright blue sky. I was so glad that Heaven smiled upon
us yesterday, it would have been so sad if it had poured; it
looked a little threatening early in the morning and a few
drops fell, but it cleared completely before nine o'clock.</p>

<p class="ind">Fritz would thank you for your dear letters himself, but
he is at the University, where they have elected him <i>Rector
Magnificus</i>, and where he has to make a speech. We have
all got our servants and carriages and horses here <i>every</i> day&mdash;300
footmen in livery, together with other servants in livery,
make 400. All the standards and colours of the whole Army
are here, and all the Colonels. Altogether, you cannot
imagine what a crush and what a scramble there is on every
occasion; there was a man crushed to death in the crowd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.459" id="pageiii.459"></a>[page&nbsp;459]</span>
the other day, which is quite dreadful. I must say good-bye
now, and send this scrawl by a messenger, whom Lord Clarendon
means to expedite. Ever your most dutiful and affectionate

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE PRINCESS ROYAL</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">K&ouml;nigsberg</span>, <i>19th October 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and humbly hopes that your Majesty will not be displeased
at his not having written sooner, but every moment has been
occupied by <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> and ceremonies here, and the visits to Royal
Personages, who are in great numbers, and Lord Clarendon
also wished to delay sending off the messenger until the
Coronation was over.</p>

<p class="ind">That most interesting and imposing ceremony took place
yesterday, and with the most complete and unalloyed success;
everything was conducted with the most perfect order; the
service not too long, the vocal music enchanting, but <i>the</i> great
feature of the ceremony was the manner in which the Princess
Royal did homage to the King. Lord Clarendon is at a loss
for words to describe to your Majesty the exquisite grace and
the intense emotion with which Her Royal Highness gave
effect to her feelings on the occasion. Many an older as well
as younger man than Lord Clarendon, who had not his interest
in the Princess Royal, were quite as unable as himself to repress
their emotion at that which was so touching, because so
unaffected and sincere....</p>

<p class="ind">If His Majesty had the mind, the judgment, and the foresight
of the Princess Royal, there would be nothing to fear, and the
example and influence of Prussia would soon be marvellously
developed. Lord Clarendon has had the honour to hold a
very long conversation with Her Royal Highness, and has
been more than ever astonished at the <i>statesmanlike</i> and comprehensive
views which she takes of the policy of Prussia, both
internal and foreign, and of the <i>duties</i> of a Constitutional King.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon is not at all astonished, but very much
pleased, to find how appreciated and beloved Her Royal
Highness is by all classes. Every member of the Royal Family
has spoken of her to Lord Clarendon in terms of admiration,
and through various channels he has had opportunities of
learning how strong the feeling of educated and enlightened
people is towards Her Royal Highness. All persons say most
truly that any one who saw Her Royal Highness yesterday
can never forget her.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon is sorry to say that the Princess Royal has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.460" id="pageiii.460"></a>[page&nbsp;460]</span>
a feverish cold to-day&mdash;nothing at all serious&mdash;and as Her
Royal Highness stayed in bed this afternoon, did not attend
the great concert at the Palace this evening, and, as Lord
Clarendon hopes, will not go to Dantzic to-morrow, Her Royal
Highness will probably be quite fit for the many fatiguing
duties she will have to perform next week....</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON'S AIMS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Berlin</span>, <i>20th October 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and humbly begs to say that yesterday he had the honour of
being sent for by the Queen, with whom he had a long and
interesting conversation....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen expressed her deep regret at the tone of the
English newspapers, but admitted that the German Press
repaid the English insults with large interest. Her Majesty
said, however, that she and the King, and all sensible men
with whom their Majesties hold communication, were determined
to disregard the attacks, and by every possible means
to draw nearer to England.</p>
<span class="rightnote">AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon took the opportunity of warning the Queen
respecting the Emperor and his <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>, that his dynasty
could only be secured by the territorial aggrandisement of
France. Lord Clarendon expressed his conviction that if the
King had resembled M. de Cavour, some strong proposals
would already have been made to them, but that the Emperor's
plans had been foiled by the honourable character of the
King. There ought, nevertheless, to be no delusion here,
but on the contrary, a careful avoidance of the traps which
cajolery and flattery were setting for Prussia, because at any
moment the Emperor might think it necessary for his own
purposes in France to seize upon the left bank of the Rhine,
and that all classes in France, no matter to what party belonging,
would be delighted at his so doing, and his popularity
and power in France would be enormously increased by it.
The Queen agreed, but was under the notion, which Lord
Clarendon was able effectually to dispel, that the dilapidated
state of French finances would prevent the Emperor from
undertaking a war upon a large scale.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon thinks that he strengthened the Queen's
opinion respecting "eventualities" and the necessity of
making preparations and evoking a national spirit against
foreign aggression, such as that recently manifested in England,
and which had done so much in favour of peace as far as we
ourselves were concerned. Her Majesty, however, said that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.461" id="pageiii.461"></a>[page&nbsp;461]</span>
Prussian policy towards Germany opened so large a chapter
that she wished to reserve the discussion of it for our next
conversation.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon fears that Count Bernstorff is disposed to
think that Austria's difficulty is Prussia's opportunity, and to
be exigent as to the concessions upon which a better understanding
between the two countries must be based. Lord
Clarendon was confidentially informed yesterday that a
Cabinet had just been held for the first time since Count
Bernstorff became a member of it, and that with respect to
internal affairs he had greatly alarmed and annoyed some of
his colleagues by his retrograde opinions. Lord Clarendon had
the honour of dining with the Crown Prince and Princess last
night. The dinner was perfect, and everything conducted
in the most admirable manner; there was afterwards a ball
at "The Queen's" which was really a splendid f&ecirc;te. The
festivities and the visitings are so uninterrupted that everybody
is unwell and tired. The Duc de Magenta's grand f&ecirc;te
takes place on the 29th. The Austrian Minister gives a ball
to-morrow (<i>Sunday</i>), which day has unfortunately been fixed
by the King, to the annoyance of all the English; but Lord
Clarendon has determined that the Embassy shall attend,
otherwise the King might consider that we wished to give
him a public lesson upon the observance of the Sabbath.
Lord Clarendon trusts that your Majesty will approve the
decision. Lord Granville's visit appears to be highly appreciated
by the Court.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>25th October 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has long seen with deep regret the persevering
efforts made by the <i>Times</i>, which leads the rest of our Press,
in attacking, vilifying, and abusing everything German, and
particularly everything Prussian. That journal had since
years shown the same bias, but it is since the Macdonald affair
of last year,<sup>49</sup> that it has assumed that tone of virulence, which
could not fail to produce the deepest indignation amongst the
people of Germany, and by degrees estrange the feelings of
the people of this country from Germany. Lord Palmerston,
probably not reading any German newspaper, nor having any
personal intercourse with that country, can hardly be aware
to what extent the mischief has already gone, though he will
agree with the Queen that national hatred between these two
peoples is a real political calamity for both. The Queen had
often intended to write to Lord Palmerston on the subject,
and to ask him whether he would not be acting in the spirit
of public duty if he endeavoured, as far at least as might be
in his power, to point out to the managers of the <i>Times</i> (which
derives some of its power from the belief abroad that it represents
more or less the feelings of the Government) how
great the injury is which it inflicts upon the best interests of
this country. She has, however, refrained from doing so,
trusting in the chance of a change in tone, and feeling that
Lord Palmerston might not like to enter into discussion with
the Editors of the <i>Times</i>....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen believes that Lord Palmerston is the only person
who could exercise any influence over Mr Delane, and even
if this should not be much, it will be important that that
gentleman should know the mischief his writings are doing,
and that the Government sincerely deplore it.</p>

ejected from his seat in the train by the railway authorities, and committed to prison.
The incident became the subject of considerable diplomatic correspondence, as well as
of some fierce attacks on Prussia in the <i>Times</i>.

</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE <i>TIMES</i></span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>30th October 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that when he received a few days
ago from Lord Russell the Memorandum which your Majesty
intended for him, and which he returned to Lord Russell, he
wrote to Mr Delane in accordance with your Majesty's wishes,
and he has this morning received the accompanying answer.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston would, however, beg to submit that
an erroneous notion prevails on the Continent as to English
newspapers.</p>

<p class="ind">The newspapers on the Continent are all more or less under
a certain degree of control, and the most prominent among
them are the organs of political parties, or of leading public
men; and it is not unnatural that Governments and Parties
on the Continent should think that English newspapers are
published under similar conditions.</p>

<p class="ind">But in this country all thriving newspapers are commercial
undertakings, and are conducted on commercial principles,
and none others are able long to maintain an existence. Attempts
have often been made to establish newspapers to be
directed by political men, and to be guided by the same considerations
by which those men would govern their own
conduct, but such papers have seldom succeeded. The Peelite
Party tried some years ago such an experiment with the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, but after spending a very large sum of
money on the undertaking they were obliged to give it up.
The <i>Times</i> is carried on as a large commercial enterprise,
though, of course, with certain political tendencies and bias,
but mainly with a view to profit upon the large capital employed.</p>

<p class="ind">The actual price at which each copy of the newspaper is
sold barely pays the expense of paper, printing, and establishment;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.464" id="pageiii.464"></a>[page&nbsp;464]</span>
it is indeed said that the price does not repay those
expenses. The profit of the newspaper arises from the price
paid for advertisements, and the greater the number of advertisements
the greater the profit. But advertisements are
sent by preference to the newspaper which has the greatest
circulation; and that paper gets the widest circulation which
is the most amusing, the most interesting, and the most
instructive. A dull paper is soon left off. The proprietors
and managers of the <i>Times</i> therefore go to great expense in
sending correspondents to all parts of the world where interesting
events are taking place, and they employ a great many
able and clever men to write articles upon all subjects which
from time to time engage public attention; and as mankind
take more pleasure in reading criticism and fault-finding than
praise, because it is soothing to individual vanity and conceit
to fancy that the reader has become wiser than those about
whom he reads, so the <i>Times</i>, in order to maintain its circulation,
criticises freely everybody and everything; and especially

such strictures are less likely to make enemies at home than
violent attacks upon parties and persons in this country.
Foreign Governments and Parties ought therefore to look
upon English newspapers in the true point of view, and not
to be too sensitive as to attacks which those papers may
contain.</p>

<span class="rightnote">DEMOCRACY IN PRUSSIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Berlin</span>, <i>5th November 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and humbly begs to say that as he leaves Berlin to-morrow,
the Princess Royal has most kindly just given him an Audience
of leave, although Her Royal Highness was still suffering
considerable pain in her ear, and was quite unfit for any
exertion. Her Royal Highness's countenance bears traces of
the severe illness of the last few days, but Lord Clarendon
trusts that the worst is now over, and that care alone is necessary
for her complete recovery. Her Royal Highness is still
so weak that she was obliged to desist from writing, which
she attempted this morning, and Lord Clarendon took the
liberty of earnestly recommending that the journey to Breslau,
upon which Her Royal Highness appeared to be bent, should
be given up. Lord Clarendon intends to repeat the same
advice to the Queen, whom he is to see this evening, as there
are to be four days of rejoicings at Breslau, for the fatigue
of which the Crown Princess must be utterly unfit.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.465" id="pageiii.465"></a>[page&nbsp;465]</span>

<p class="ind">Her Royal Highness is much alarmed at the state of things
here, and Lord Clarendon thinks with great reason, for the
King has quite made up his mind as to the course that he will
pursue. He sees democracy and revolution in every symptom
of opposition to his will. His Ministers are mere clerks, who
are quite content to register the King's decrees, and there is
no person from whom His Majesty seeks advice, or indeed
who is capable or would have the moral courage to give it. The
King will always religiously keep his word, and will never
overturn the institutions he has sworn to maintain, but they
are so distasteful to him, and so much at variance with his
habit of thought and settled opinions as to the rights of the
Crown, that His Majesty will never, if he can avoid it, accept
the consequences of representative Government, or allow it
to be a reality. This is generally known, and among the
middle classes is producing an uneasy and resentful feeling,
but as far as Lord Clarendon is able to judge, there is no fear
of revolution&mdash;the Army is too strong, and the recollection
of 1848 is too fresh to allow of acts of violence.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon had the honour of an Audience of the King
on Sunday. His Majesty was most friendly and kind, but
evidently unwell and irritable. Lord Clarendon therefore
thought that it would be neither prudent nor useful to say
the many things that the Queen had wished that the King
should hear from Lord Clarendon. He touched upon the
subject of Constitutional Government, and His Majesty said:
"I have sworn to maintain our Institutions, and I declare to
you, and I wish you to inform your Government, that I will
maintain them."</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Clarendon proposes to remain Friday at Brussels, and
hopes to have the honour of seeing the King.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE AFFAIR OF THE <i>TRENT</i></span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>13th November 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"> ... Viscount Palmerston met yesterday at dinner at
Baron Brunnow's the Grand Duke Constantine and the Grand
Duchess, and they were overflowing with thankfulness for
the kind and gracious reception they had met with at Windsor
Castle.</p>

<p class="ind">There was reason to suspect that an American federal
steamer of war of eight guns, which had lately arrived at
Falmouth, and from thence at Southampton, was intended to
intercept the Mail Packet coming home with the West Indian
Mail, in order to take out of her Messrs Mason and Slidell,
the two Envoys from the Southern Confederacy, supposed
to be coming in her.<a id="footnotetagXXX53" name="footnotetagXXX53"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston had on Monday a meeting at the
Treasury of the Chancellor, Doctor Lushington, the three Law
Officers,<a id="footnotetagXXX54" name="footnotetagXXX54"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX54"><sup>54</sup></a> the Duke of Somerset, Sir George Grey, and Mr
Hammond.<a id="footnotetagXXX55" name="footnotetagXXX55"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX55"><sup>55</sup></a> The result of their deliberation was that, according
to the Law of Nations, as laid down by Lord Stowell,
and practised and enforced by England in the war with France,
the Northern Union being a belligerent is entitled by its ships
of war to stop and search any neutral Merchantmen, and the
West India Packet is such; to search her if there is reasonable
suspicion that she is carrying enemy's despatches, and
if such are found on board to take her to a port of the belligerent,
and there to proceed against her for condemnation.
Such being ruled to be the law, the only thing that could be
done was to order the <i>Phaeton</i> frigate to drop down to Yarmouth
Roads from Portsmouth, and to watch the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.467" id="pageiii.467"></a>[page&nbsp;467]</span>
steamer, and to see that she did not exercise this belligerent
right within the three-mile limit of British jurisdiction, and
this was done. But Viscount Palmerston sent yesterday for
Mr Adams to ask him about this matter, and to represent to
him how unwise it would be to create irritation in this country
merely for the sake of preventing the landing of Mr Slidell,
whose presence here would have no more effect on the policy
of your Majesty with regard to America than the presence
of the three other Southern Deputies who have been here for
many months. Mr Adams assured Viscount Palmerston
that the American steamer had orders not to meddle with any
vessel under any foreign flag; that it came to intercept the
<i>Nashville</i>, the Confederate ship in which it was thought the
Southern Envoys might be coming; and not having met with
her was going back to the American coast to watch some
Merchantmen supposed to be taking arms to the Southern
ports.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston heard from a source likely to be well
informed that at the interview between the Emperor and the
King of Prussia at Compi&egrave;gne, the Emperor, among other
things, said to the King that there were three systems of alliance
between which France and Prussia might choose: an
alliance of France with England, an alliance of Prussia with
England, an alliance of France with Prussia. The first the
Emperor said now to a certain degree exists, but is precarious
and not likely to last long, because England is too exacting;
the second would not be useful to Prussia, but might be
dangerous, inasmuch as it would look like hostility to France,
and England would not be likely to back Prussia effectually
if a rupture took place between Prussia and France. The
last was the system best for Prussia, and was calculated to
promote her interests; at all events, the Emperor hoped that
if at any time there should be a rupture between France and
England, Prussia would remain neutral. The King of Prussia
said he was not come to discuss matters of that kind with the
Emperor, but only to pay him a visit of compliment. Your
Majesty will be able to compare this statement with the accounts
your Majesty may have received of what passed at
that visit....</p>

<p class="ind">The Chancellor<sup>56</sup> told the Cabinet as he was going away
that he would soon have to shut up the Court of Chancery in
consequence of having disposed of all the suits before it;
and that in future the progress of a Chancery suit will be the
emblem of rapidity, and not as formerly synonymous with
endless delay.</p>

exertion proved too severe for him; on the 24th he complained of rheumatic pains, and
of prolonged sleeplessness.

<span class="rightnote">REDRESS DEMANDED</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>29th November 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and begs to state that the Cabinet at its meeting
this afternoon resumed the consideration of the forcible capture
of the Southern Envoys from on board the <i>Trent</i> steamer
upon which the law officers had yesterday given the opinion
contained in the accompanying report. The law officers
and Doctor Phillimore, Counsel to the Admiralty, were in
attendance. The result was that it appeared to the Cabinet
that a gross outrage and violation of international law has
been committed, and that your Majesty should be advised to
demand reparation and redress. The Cabinet is to meet
again to-morrow at two, by which time Lord Russell will have
prepared an instruction to Lord Lyons for the consideration
of the Cabinet, and for submission afterwards to your Majesty.
The general outline and tenor which appeared to meet the
opinions of the Cabinet would be, that the Washington Government
should be told that what has been done is a violation of
international law, and of the rights of Great Britain, and that
your Majesty's Government trust that the act will be disavowed
and the prisoners set free and restored to British
Protection; and that Lord Lyons should be instructed that if
this demand is refused he should retire from the United States.</p>

<p class="ind">It is stated by Mrs and Miss Slidell, who are now in London,
that the Northern officer who came on board the <i>Trent</i> said
that they were acting on their own responsibility without
instructions from Washington; that very possibly their act
might be disavowed and the prisoners set free on their arrival
at Washington. But it was known that the <i>San Jacinto</i>,
though come from the African station, had arrived from thence
several weeks before, and had been at St Thomas, and had there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.469" id="pageiii.469"></a>[page&nbsp;469]</span>
received communications from New York; and it is also said
that General Scott, who has recently arrived in France, has
said to Americans in Paris that he has come not on an excursion
of pleasure, but on diplomatic business; that the seizure
of these envoys was discussed in Cabinet at Washington, he
being present, and was deliberately determined upon and
ordered; that the Washington Cabinet fully foresaw it might
lead to war with England; and that he was commissioned to
propose to France in that case to join the Northern States in
war against England, and to offer France in that case the
restoration of the French Province of Canada.</p>

<p class="ind">General Scott will probably find himself much mistaken as
to the success of his overtures; for the French Government
is more disposed towards the South than the North, and is
probably thinking more about Cotton than about Canada....</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Foreign Office</span>, <i>29th November 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty;
Mr Gladstone has undertaken to explain to your Majesty
what has taken place at the Cabinet to-day.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Russell proposes to frame a draft for to-morrow's
Cabinet of a despatch to Lord Lyons, directing him to ask for
the release of Messrs Mason and Slidell and their two companions,
and an apology. In case these requirements should
be refused, Lord Lyons should ask for his passports.</p>

<p class="ind">The Lord Chancellor and the law officers of the Crown
are clear upon the law of the case.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Russell will be glad to have your Majesty's opinion on
the draft which will go to your Majesty about four o'clock
to-morrow, without loss of time, as the packet goes to-morrow
evening.<sup>58</sup></p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 58: The draft of the despatch to Lord Lyons reached Windsor on the evening of the 30th,
and, in spite of his weak and suffering state, the Prince prepared the draft of the Queen's
letter early the following morning. The letter has been printed in <i>facsimile</i> by Sir
Theodore Martin, who adds that it has a special value as "representing the last political
Memorandum written by the Prince, while it was at the same time inferior to none of
them, as will presently be seen, in the importance of its results. It shows, like most of
his Memorandums, by the corrections in the Queen's hand, how the minds of both were
continually brought to bear upon the subjects with which they dealt."

<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 2em;">The Queen returns these important drafts, which upon the
whole she approves, but she cannot help feeling that the main
draft, that for communication to the American Government,
is somewhat meagre. She should have liked to have seen the
expression of a hope that the American captain did not act
under instructions, or, if he did, that he misapprehended
them&mdash;that the United States Government must be fully
aware that the British Government could not allow its flag
to be insulted, and the security of her mail communications
to be placed to jeopardy, and Her Majesty's Government are
unwilling to believe that the United States Government intended
wantonly to put an insult upon this country, and to
add to their many distressing complications by forcing a
question of dispute upon us, and that we are therefore glad to
believe that upon a full consideration of the circumstances,
and of the undoubted breach of international law committed,
they would spontaneously offer such redress as alone could
satisfy this country, viz. the restoration of the unfortunate
passengers and a suitable apology.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Charles Wood, with his humble duty, begs to enclose to
your Majesty two letters from India, one giving an account
of Lord Canning's investing the Indian Chiefs with the Star
of India; and the other an account of poor Lady Canning's
illness and death, which, even at this sad moment, may not be
without interest for your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Charles Wood hopes that he may be forgiven if, when
having to address your Majesty, he ventures to lay before your
Majesty the expression of his heartfelt sympathy in the sorrow
under which your Majesty is now suffering, and his deep sense
of the irreparable calamity which has befallen your Majesty
and the country.</p>

<p class="ind">Though it cannot be any consolation, it must be gratifying
to your Majesty to learn the deep and universal feeling of
regret and sorrow which prevails amongst all classes of your
Majesty's subjects, and in none so strongly as in those who
have had the most opportunity of appreciating the inestimable
value of those services, of which by this awful dispensation
of Providence the country has been deprived.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Barrackpore</span>, <i>22nd November 1861</i>.<a id="footnotetagXXX65" name="footnotetagXXX65"></a><a href="#footnoteXXX65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
Your Majesty will have heard by the last mail of the heavy
blow which has fallen upon Lord Canning. The kindness of
your Majesty to Lady Canning has been so invariable and so
great that he feels it to be right that your Majesty should
receive a sure account of her last illness with as little delay
as possible.</p>

<p class="ind">The funeral is over. It took place quite privately at sunrise
on the 19th. There is no burial-place for the Governor-General
or his family, and the cemeteries at Calcutta are odious
in many ways: Lord Canning has therefore set a portion of
the garden at Barrackpore (fifteen miles from Calcutta) apart
for the purpose. It is a beautiful spot&mdash;looking upon that
reach of the grand river which she was so fond of drawing&mdash;shaded
from the glare of the sun by high trees&mdash;and amongst the
bright shrubs and flowers in which she had so much pleasure.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty will be glad, but not surprised, to know of the
deep respect which has been paid to her memory, not only by
the familiar members of the household and intimate friends,
who refused to let any hired hands perform the last offices, but
by the Civil and Military bodies, and by the community at
large. The coffin was conveyed to Barrackpore by the
Artillery, and was borne through the Garden by English
soldiers.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning feels sure that your Majesty will not consider
these details as an intrusion. He feels sure of your Majesty's
kind sympathy. She loved your Majesty dearly, and Lord
Canning is certain that he is doing what would have been her
wish in thus venturing to write to your Majesty. In the last
connected conversation which he had with her, just before the
illness became really threatening, she said that she must write
again to the Queen, "for I don't want her to think that it was
out of laziness that I was not at Allahabad." The fact is, that
she had always intended to be present at the Investiture, and
had made all her arrangements to go from Darjeeling to Allahabad
for the purpose; but Lord Canning, hearing of the bad
state of the roads, owing to the heavy and unseasonable rains,
and knowing how fatiguing an additional journey of nearly
900 miles would be, had entreated her to abandon the intention,
and to stay longer in the Hills, and then go straight to Calcutta.
Whether all might have gone differently if the first
plan had been held to, God alone knows. His will has been
done.</p>

desolate child&mdash;who drags on a weary, pleasureless existence!
I am also anxious to repeat <i>one</i> thing, and <i>that one</i> is <i>my

<span class="rightnote">BUSINESS STILL TRANSACTED</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Piccadilly</span>, <i>30th December 1861</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and has read with deep emotion your Majesty's
letter of the 26th, every word of which went straight to the
heart. Viscount Palmerston would, however, humbly express
a hope that the intensity of your Majesty's grief may not lead
your Majesty to neglect your health, the preservation of which
is so important for the welfare of your Majesty's children, and
for that of your Majesty's devotedly attached and affectionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.477" id="pageiii.477"></a>[page&nbsp;477]</span>
subjects; and which is so essentially necessary to enable your
Majesty to perform those duties which it will be the object of
your Majesty's life to fulfil.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Granville has communicated to Viscount Palmerston
your Majesty's wish that Mr Dilke<sup>66</sup> should be made a Baronet,
and that Mr Bowring<sup>67</sup> should be made a Companion of the
Bath, and both of these things will be done accordingly. But
there are three other persons whose names Viscount Palmerston
has for some time wished to submit to your Majesty for
the dignity of Baronet, and if your Majesty should be graciously
pleased to approve of them, the list would stand as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="outdent">Mr Dilke.</span></p>

<p><span class="outdent">Mr William Brown</span>,<sup>68</sup> of Liverpool, a very wealthy and
  distinguished merchant, who lately made a magnificent
  present of a public library to his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p><span class="outdent">Mr Thomas Davies Lloyd</span>, a rich and highly respectable
  gentleman of the county of Carnarvon.</p>

<p><span class="outdent">Mr Rich</span>, to whom the Government is under great obligation,
  for having of his own accord and without any condition
  vacated last year his seat for Richmond in Yorkshire,
  and having thus enabled the Government to obtain the
  valuable services of Mr Roundell Palmer as your Majesty's
  Solicitor-General.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston has put into this box some private
letters which Lord Russell thinks your Majesty might perhaps
like to look at.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 66: Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke was on the Executive Committee of the Exhibition of
1851, and on the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1862. He died in 1869.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 67: Mr Edgar Bowring's Companionship was conferred on him for services in connection
with the earlier Exhibition. He was afterwards M.P. for Exeter, 1868-1874.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 68: Mr Brown became a baronet in 1863.

<span class="rightnote">COMFORT AND HOPE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Osborne</span>, <i>10th January 1862</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Canning little thought when he wrote his kind and
touching letter of the 22nd November, that it would only reach
the Queen when <i>she</i> was <i>smitten</i> and <i>bowed</i> down to the earth
by an event similar to the one which he describes&mdash;and, strange
to say, by a disease greatly analogous to the one which took
from him <i>all</i> that he loved best. In the case of her adored,
precious, perfect, and great husband, her dear lord and master,
to whom this Nation owed more than it ever can truly know,
however, the fever went on most favourably till the day
previous to the awful calamity, and then it was congestion of
the lungs and want of strength of circulation (the beloved
Prince had always a weak and feeble pulse), which at the critical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii.478" id="pageiii.478"></a>[page&nbsp;478]</span>
moment, indeed only two hours before God took him, caused
this awful result. To lose one's partner in life is, as Lord
Canning knows, like losing <i>half</i> of one's <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i>,
torn
forcibly away&mdash;and dear Lady Canning was such a dear,
worthy, devoted wife! But to the Queen&mdash;to a poor helpless
woman&mdash;it is not that only&mdash;it is the stay, support and comfort
which is lost! To the Queen it is like <i>death</i> in life! Great
and small&mdash;<i>nothing</i> was done without his loving advice and
help&mdash;and she feels <i>alone</i> in the wide world, with many helpless
children (except the Princess Royal) to look to her&mdash;and the
whole nation to look to her&mdash;<i>now</i> when she can barely struggle
with her wretched existence! Her misery&mdash;her utter despair&mdash;she
<i>cannot</i> describe! Her <i>only</i> support&mdash;the <i>only</i> ray of
comfort she gets for <i>a moment</i>, is in the <i>firm conviction</i> and
certainty of his nearness, his undying love, and of their eternal
reunion! Only she prays always, and pines for the latter with
an anxiety she cannot describe. Like dear Lady Canning,
the Queen's darling is to rest in a garden&mdash;at Frogmore, in
a Mausoleum the Queen is going to build for him and herself.</p>

<p class="ind">Though ill, the Queen was able to tell her precious angel of
Lord Canning's bereavement, and he was deeply grieved,
recurring to it several times, and saying, "What a loss! She
was such a distinguished person!"</p>

<p class="ind">May God comfort and support Lord Canning, and may he
think in his sorrow of his widowed and broken-hearted Sovereign&mdash;bowed
to the earth with the greatest of human sufferings
and misfortunes! She lived but <i>for</i> her husband!</p>

<p class="ind">The sympathy of the many thousands of her subjects, but
above all their sorrow and their admiration for him, are soothing
to her bleeding, pierced heart!</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen's precious husband, though wandering occasionally,
was conscious till nearly the last, and knew her and kissed
her an hour before his pure spirit fled to its worthy and fit
eternal Home!</p>

<p>
This is the third volume of three. </p>

<p style="margin-top:-1em;">The index is in this volume, with links to all
three volumes; and some footnotes are linked between volumes.</p>

<p style="margin-top:-1em;">These links are designed to work when
the book is read on line. However, if you want to download all
three volumes and have the links work on your own computer,
then follow these directions carefully.
</p>

<p>
1. Create a directory (folder) named whatever you like (e.g., Victoria).
(The name of this directory (folder) is not critical, but the inner
folders <i>must</i> be named as listed below, or the links between
volumes will <i>not</i> work).</p>

<p>
2. In that directory (folder) create 3 directories (folders) named</p>
<ul class="nonetn">
     <li>20023</li>
	 <li>24780</li>
	 <li>28649</li>
	 </ul>

<p>
3. Create the following directories (folders):
</p>
<ul class="nonetn">
     <li>In the 20023 directory create a directory named 20023-h</li>
	 <li>In the 24780 directory create a directory named 24780-h</li>
	 <li>In the 28649 directory create a directory named 28649-h</li>
	 </ul>

<p>
4. Download the <i>zipped</i> html version of each volume.
</p>
<ul class="nonetn">
     <li>Download Vol. I from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20023">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20023</a></li>
	 <li>Download Vol. II from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/24780">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/24780</a></li>
	 <li>Download Vol. III from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28649">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28649</a></li>
	 </ul>

<p>
5. Unzip the downloaded files and move them into the appropriate directories:
</p>
<ul class="nonetn">
     <li>Move the unzipped 20023-h.htm file and its "images" directory
     into your 20023-h directory.</li>
	 <li>Move the unzipped 24780-h.htm file and its "images" directory
	 into your 24780-h directory.</li>
	 <li>Move the unzipped 28649-h.htm file and its "images" directory
	 into your 28649-h directory.</li>
	 </ul>

<h5>Errata - old typos:</h5>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors have been corrected.</p>

<p>The remaining corrections made are indicated by dotted lines under the corrections.</p>
<p style="margin-top:-1em;">Scroll the mouse over the word and the original text will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'apprear'">appear</ins>.</p>

<p>Note: The letter 't' was omitted from three words ('sentiments', 'ind&eacute;pendants', and a second instance of 'sentiments',
in a letter fron Emperor Fran&ccedil;ois Joseph (<i>le 8 Mars 1859</i>). It seems unlikely to have been a printer's error.</p>
